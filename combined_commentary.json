    "<1><1> Combined Commentary on the Title\n\nThe Tibetan title 'བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་སྤྱོད་པ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་བཞུགས་སོ། །' (Byang chub sems dpa'i spyod pa la 'jug pa bzhugs so) corresponds to the Sanskrit 'Bodhicaryāvatāra' (बोधिचर्यावतारः), which means 'Entry into the Conduct of the Bodhisattva' or 'An Introduction to the Practice of a Bodhisattva.' When analyzing the Sanskrit components, 'bodhi' means enlightenment, 'sattva' means hero or warrior, 'caryā' means conduct, and 'avatāra' means entering. This title was established based on the subject matter of the text, which is one of several common ways to title Buddhist works, others being through measure of expression, function, location, retinue, time, or metaphor. The purpose of assigning such a title is to convey meaning and prevent confusion, as stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra: 'If names were not assigned, the entire world would be confused. Therefore, to dispel confusion, the Protector established names.' Presenting the title at the beginning serves practical purposes: it allows those with sharp faculties to immediately grasp the subject matter, establishes authenticity by referencing the original Sanskrit, honors the lineage of transmission through the translators and paṇḍitas, and makes the text easier to locate.",
    "<1><2> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n༄༅༅། ། - These are ornamental marks indicating the beginning of a Tibetan text.\n\nརྒྱ་གར་སྐད་དུ། བོ་དྷི་སཏྭ་ཙརྱ་ཨ་བ་ཏཱ་ར། - This line presents the Sanskrit title of the text. In the refined Sanskrit language of India, which is considered one of the four major dissimilar languages and is often called 'the language of the gods,' this treatise is titled 'Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra.' This Sanskrit title is broken down as follows: 'Bodhi' means awakening or enlightenment; 'sattva' means hero, warrior, or being of courage; 'carya' means conduct or practice; and 'avatāra' means entering or engagement.\n\nThe inclusion of the Sanskrit title serves multiple purposes: it establishes authenticity of the source text, creates habitual patterns for understanding Sanskrit terminology, reminds readers of the kindness of translators and scholars, and makes the text easier to search for. As stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra: 'If names were not assigned, the entire world would fall into confusion. Therefore, to dispel confusion, the Protector assigned names.'\n\nWhen translated into Tibetan, the title becomes 'Byang chub sems dpa'i spyod pa la 'jug pa,' which means 'Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva.' According to the Jñānajāla (Wisdom Net): 'Purification means cleansing because it is free from stains; enlightenment means completion because qualities are fully developed.' Thus, 'byang' (purification) refers to purifying the two obscurations and their habitual tendencies; 'chub' (enlightenment) refers to comprehending all wisdom qualities; and 'sems dpa'' (hero of mind) refers to one who remains brave in undertaking difficult practices for the sake of enlightenment, as stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra: 'One who is steadfast, unmoved by suffering, bad companions, and hearing profound teachings.'\n\nRegarding the title classification, generally titles can be assigned based on subject matter, measure of expression, function, place, time, person, simile, and so forth—this title belongs to the first category, as it is named after its subject matter. This allows those with sharp faculties to understand the content briefly from the title alone.",
    "<1><3> Combined Commentary on the Title\n\nIn Sanskrit language, this text is titled 'Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra.' Among the four major linguistic traditions present in noble India, this title comes from the refined Sanskrit language, often referred to as the divine language. When translated into the best and most comprehensible language of Tibet, it becomes 'བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་སྤྱོད་པ་ལ་འཇུག་པ' (Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Conduct).\n\nBreaking down the components of this title: 'Bodhi' means awakening or enlightenment (བྱང་ཆུབ་ - byang chub); 'sattva' means hero or warrior (སེམས་དཔའ་ - sems dpa'); 'caryā' means conduct or practice (སྤྱོད་པ་ - spyod pa); and 'avatāra' means entering or engaging (འཇུག་པ་ - 'jug pa).\n\nRegarding how this title was established: Generally, titles can be assigned based on various factors including the subject matter, the measure of expression, function, place, time, person, examples, and so forth. This particular title belongs to the first category, being named after its subject matter.\n\nThe significance of the title is profound. As stated in the Jñānajāla (Wisdom Net): 'Purified because stains are removed, thus 'awakening'; fully developed in qualities, thus 'enlightenment'.' Accordingly, 'byang' (awakening) refers to being purified and cleansed of the two obscurations along with their latent tendencies; 'chub' (enlightenment) means completely comprehending all wisdom qualities to be realized. A 'sems dpa'' (spiritual warrior) is one who remains courageous and undaunted in practicing difficult acts for the sake of attaining enlightenment.\n\nThe 'conduct' (spyod pa) refers to what all bodhisattvas must train in, primarily the six perfections, as noted by the sovereign Longchenpa. 'Engaging' ('jug pa) indicates that this text perfectly and correctly teaches the methods of practice according to the mental training of beginners.\n\nThe purpose of stating the title is significant. As mentioned in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra: 'If names were not assigned, the entire world would be confused. Therefore, to dispel confusion, the Protector established the assignment of names.' By naming it after the subject matter, those with sharp faculties can understand the content briefly just from the title. Stating the Sanskrit language establishes habitual tendencies for that language, ensures authenticity of the source, and serves as a reminder of the kindness of the translators and scholars.",
    "<1><4> Combined Commentary on the Source Text: སངས་རྒྱས་དང་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའ་ཐམས་ཅད་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ། །\n\n'Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.'\n\nThis line of homage was arranged by the translator according to the 'homage by royal decree' established during the time of King Tri Ralpachen. Originally, translators would pay homage to their personal deities without following a standardized format, but King Ralpachen instituted a system where the homage would indicate which of the three scriptural collections (Tripiṭaka) a text belonged to. This particular homage follows the Sūtra style, indicating that this text primarily belongs to the Sūtra Piṭaka, which consists of teachings delivered through questions and answers between the Buddha and bodhisattvas.\n\nThe term 'Buddha' refers to one who has awakened from the deep sleep of ignorance and whose intelligence has fully blossomed regarding all knowable phenomena—like a lotus flower in full bloom. 'Bodhisattva' refers to those who have generated the aspiration for supreme awakening and who courageously pursue it through diligent practice of the six perfections.\n\nThis homage serves multiple purposes: it pacifies obstacles to translation, classifies the text, establishes the translator as a noble person, and creates the conditions for accumulating virtue. It represents the virtuous beginning of the treatise, as Master Śubhadeva notes that the text is composed with virtue at its beginning (homage), middle (main content), and end (dedication).\n\nThe homage constitutes the first part of the preliminary elements for engaging in the composition of the treatise, to be followed by the commitment to compose, expressions of humility, and the generation of enthusiasm for the work ahead.",
    "<1><5> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nHaving paid homage to whom? To the Sugatas (bde gshegs) who are 'well-gone' because they have traveled the pleasant path of the bodhisattva vehicle to the state of perfect buddhahood, thus indicating the Buddha jewel. The Sanskrit term 'sugata' can be explained in three ways:\n\n'Gone excellently or beautifully' means gone without any trace of defilements, like a person of beautiful form. This distinguishes buddhas from samsara and non-Buddhist renunciants.\n\n'Gone never to return' means having uprooted the seed of self-view, never returning to samsara, like firewood that once burned cannot regrow. This distinguishes buddhas from stream-enterers, once-returners, and those on non-Buddhist paths.\n\n'Gone completely or perfectly' means having perfected all qualities of abandonment and realization, like a perfectly filled vase. This distinguishes buddhas from śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have only partial realization.\n\n'Possessing the dharmakāya' indicates the Dharma jewel. As stated in the Uttaratantra: 'The dharmakāya should be understood as twofold: the utterly pure dharmadhātu and its concordant cause, which teaches both profound and various aspects.' The Buddha possesses both the dharmakāya of realization and the teachings of the two truths.\n\n'Together with their children' indicates the Saṅgha jewel, specifically the bodhisattva āryas. As stated in the Uttaratantra: 'Those who have devotion to the supreme vehicle as their seed, wisdom as their mother, the womb of meditative bliss as their abode, and compassion as their nurse—they are the sons born in the likeness of the Sage.' They are called the sugatas' sons because they are born into the Buddha's lineage and maintain it.\n\n'Respectfully prostrating to all who are worthy of veneration' means prostrating with body, speech, and mind not only to the Three Jewels but also to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, preceptors, and all worthy of respect. This homage brings both temporary and ultimate happiness, as stated in the Sutra in Praise of the Buddha's Qualities.\n\nThe second part connects to 'I shall explain the entrance into the vow of the children of the Sugatas'—the complete system of the bodhisattva path encompassing the three types of ethical discipline: restraining from wrongdoing, gathering virtuous qualities, and benefiting sentient beings.\n\n'According to scripture' indicates trustworthiness and that this is not personal invention. Though the Buddha's teachings already exist, they are vast and scattered, while beings in degenerate times have short lives and weak intelligence. This treatise compiles these teachings into a concise, easy-to-understand format. It organizes what is scattered, clarifies what is unclear, and presents concisely what is extensively taught elsewhere.\n\nThe purpose of the author's commitment to explain is that noble beings never abandon their promises, so the composition will be completed. As stated in Prajñādaṇḍa: 'Noble ones do not make many promises, but if they undertake something difficult, like an inscription carved in stone, they will not change their word even at the cost of their life.'",

    "<1><7> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དགེ་བ་བསྒོམ་ཕྱིར་བདག་གི་དད་པའི་ཤུགས། །' (For the sake of cultivating virtue, my strength of faith...)\n\nFor the sake of cultivating virtue—specifically the mind of awakening (bodhicitta) and the six perfections of bodhisattva conduct—my confidence and momentum of faith in bodhisattva practice will be increased through composing this text. Śāntideva indicates there is a clear purpose for his composition: to familiarize his own mind so that his understanding will not deteriorate but rather increase. By setting down his realizations as a treatise, his faith, wisdom, and compassion will develop more and more.\n\n'འདི་དག་གིས་ཀྱང་རེ་ཞིག་འཕེལ་འགྱུར་ལ། །' (Through these [verses], it will increase for a while...)\n\nFor the time being, my faith will grow through these verses, and if I become thoroughly familiar with them through repeated practice, my understanding will continue to develop enormously. The phrase 'for the time being' (རེ་ཞིག་) suggests that there is also concern for the welfare of others beyond the author's immediate benefit. Some commentators like Gendun Lha and Namnang explain that this phrase indicates the composition is not solely for personal benefit.\n\n'བདག་དང་སྐལ་བ་མཉམ་པ་གཞན་གྱིས་ཀྱང་། །' (And others who share my level of spiritual development...)\n\nAdditionally, taking a humble position, others of similar fortune—those who are like-minded, who aspire to bodhisattva conduct and maintain impartiality—who share my spiritual disposition and earnestly seek the conduct of bodhisattvas may also benefit from this text. By stating this, Śāntideva reveals his modest character, showing humility rather than claiming special authority.\n\n'ཅི་སྟེ་འདི་དག་མཐོང་ན་དོན་ཡོད་འགྱུར། །' (If they should see these, they will become meaningful.)\n\nIf others of equal fortune should happen to see what has been composed in this text, it will become meaningful for them just as it is for me. In the Great Commentary, 'should' (ཅི་སྟེ་) is explained as 'if' (གལ་ཏེ་), indicating that if others see what has been established through the author's own experience, they will find purpose in it, becoming joyful and enthusiastic about engaging in bodhisattva conduct. This generates enthusiasm in others and provides the ultimate purpose of the text: to guide practitioners toward the unsurpassed result—the Dharmakāya of the Sugatas surrounded by the assembly of bodhisattva children.\n\nThis passage thus reveals the four aspects of purpose in the text: the subject matter (bodhisattva conduct), the purpose (increasing faith and understanding), the ultimate purpose (attaining enlightenment), and the connection between these elements, establishing both the author's motivation and the text's intended benefit for its readers.",
    "<1><8> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe leisures and endowments (dal 'byor) refer to a precious human body possessing eighteen special qualities. 'Leisures' refers to freedom from eight unfavorable conditions, while 'endowments' refers to the possession of ten special resources.\n\nThe eight unfavorable conditions or states without freedom are: being born in hell realms, as hungry ghosts, as animals, as long-lived gods, in uncivilized lands among barbarians, holding wrong views, being born when no Buddha appears, and being mute or having impaired faculties.\n\nThe ten resources or endowments include five personal endowments: being human with complete faculties, being born in a central land where the Dharma is taught, not having committed extreme negative actions such as the five heinous deeds, and having faith in the Buddha's teachings. The five circumstantial endowments are: a Buddha has appeared in the world, he has taught the Dharma, the teachings remain available, there are followers practicing those teachings, and there are compassionate benefactors supporting practitioners.\n\nThis precious human body with leisures and endowments is extremely difficult to obtain when considering its causes, examples, or numbers. In terms of causes, one must have pure moral discipline as a foundation, virtues such as generosity as companions, and pure aspirational prayers as connections. In terms of examples, it is more difficult to find than a blind turtle surfacing once every hundred years from the depths of the ocean and putting its neck through a yoke floating on the vast waters. In terms of numbers, beings in lower realms vastly outnumber humans who have obtained this precious opportunity.\n\nHaving obtained this rare and precious human rebirth through the kindness of our teachers, the Three Jewels, and our own past virtues, we now possess a support capable of accomplishing the goals of the three types of individuals—higher rebirth and definite goodness. If we fail to use this opportunity to practice the holy Dharma and instead waste our life in meaningless activities, how could we expect to obtain such perfect conditions again in the future? Since death is uncertain and we cannot be sure we won't die even tonight, we must urgently extract the essence from this precious human life.\n\nAs advised in the Letter to a Friend: 'A human birth is even harder to find than the chance meeting of a turtle with the hole in a yoke floating on the vast ocean. Therefore, through practicing the holy Dharma, make this meaningful.' We should abandon worldly distractions and dedicate ourselves to Dharma practice from this moment forward, following Dīpaṃkara's advice to extract the essence of our lives like a swan separating milk from water.",
    "<1><9> Combined Commentary Explanation, Sentence by Sentence\n\n**ཇི་ལྟར་མཚན་མོ་མུན་ནག་སྤྲིན་རུམ་ན།** (Just as at night, in the dark midst of clouds,)\nThis opening line presents an example: just as at night, in the darkness without the sun, in the black darkness without the moon, in the dense clouds without stars—a situation of complete darkness where nothing can be seen.\n\n**གློག་འགྱུ་སྐད་ཅིག་རབ་སྣང་སྟོན་པ་ལྟར།** (Lightning flashes for an instant, brilliantly illuminating things,)\nHere, lightning momentarily illuminates forms for just a brief instant, allowing us to see what was previously hidden in darkness. This fleeting illumination represents a rare opportunity for clarity in an otherwise obscured state.\n\n**དེ་བཞིན་སངས་རྒྱས་མཐུ་ཡིས་བརྒྱ་ལམ་ན།** (Similarly, through the power of the Buddha, once in a hundred times,)\nJust as lightning provides brief illumination, through the combined power of the Buddhas' aspirations and enlightened intent, along with the strength of one's own previously accumulated merit, only occasionally—'once in a hundred times' indicating rarity—does something special occur.\n\n**འཇིག་རྟེན་བསོད་ནམས་བློ་གྲོས་ཐང་འགའ་འབྱུང་།** (Wisdom and merit arise briefly in worldly beings.)\nThis final line indicates that for worldly beings dwelling in the thick darkness of suffering due to negative actions, there arises, only rarely and briefly, the wisdom to practice virtue and merit—a fleeting moment of spiritual clarity. Since this occurrence is extremely rare and does not happen frequently or for extended periods, when the wish to practice virtue does arise, one should not let it deteriorate, but rather enhance it.\n\nThis verse is explaining that in this era when our virtues are weak and our misdeeds powerful, thoughts of performing meritorious actions arise only occasionally in beings, not continuously. The verse forms part of a larger explanation of the benefits of bodhicitta, showing how precious and rare the opportunity is to generate virtuous thoughts. Understanding this rarity, we should strive diligently to cultivate virtue and abandon negativity whenever such wisdom arises in our minds, just as we would take full advantage of a lightning flash in darkness to find our way.",
    "<1><10> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nTherefore, for these reasons mentioned above, virtuous deeds are perpetually feeble with little strength—just as in a dark night when lightning flashes through clouds, momentarily illuminating forms with clarity, similarly, through the power of the Buddhas, occasionally worldly beings experience thoughts of virtue, thinking 'I should accumulate merit,' but this does not occur continuously.\n\nSince the basis and attitude are difficult to obtain and of short duration, virtuous antidotes are invariably weak, constantly remaining feeble like flickering lightning.\n\nIn contrast, the mind of sin and non-virtue, like the darkness of thick clouds, has great power. Since the causes of non-virtue are easily accumulated, powerful negative actions arise that are extremely difficult to reverse and utterly unbearable, creating causes for lower rebirths and producing great fear.\n\nUnderstanding this situation—when virtue is weak and negativity is strong—one must generate virtues capable of overcoming these negative forces. That powerful negativity cannot be overcome by any other ordinary virtue except the precious bodhicitta, which shines brilliantly like the sun.\n\nWhat virtue other than the perfect bodhicitta, which embodies wisdom and compassion, could overpower such great negativity? Nothing else could subdue these unbearable negativities that lead to hell realms. As stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'Just as cats overpower and intimidate mice with their gaze, similarly, the precious eye of omniscient mind overpowers and intimidates the mice of karma and afflictions.'\n\nThe ability of ultimate bodhicitta to eliminate the seeds of obscurations is not the main focus here. Rather, this section shows the benefits of conventional bodhicitta, which purifies previously accumulated causes of lower rebirths and prevents future ones from arising.",
    "<1><11> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nབསྐལ་པ་དུ་མར་རབ་དགོངས་མཛད་པ་ཡི། །\nFor countless kalpas, such as the three immeasurable eons, the Lords of Sages thoroughly contemplated and examined methods to benefit sentient beings. During this extensive period, the Buddhas focused exclusively on finding approaches that would bring both temporary and ultimate benefit and happiness to infinite sentient beings.\n\nཐུབ་དབང་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་འདི་ཉིད་ཕན་པར་གཟིགས། །\nThese supreme Buddhas perceived that bodhicitta alone is truly beneficial for sentient beings. They saw that it has unique power for purifying previously committed negative actions, severing the continuity of future negativities, overwhelming the afflictions in one's mindstream, increasing even the smallest roots of virtue, and ultimately leading to great enlightenment.\n\nའདིས་ནི་ཚད་མེད་སྐྱེ་བོའི་ཚོགས་རྣམས་ཀྱིས། །\nThrough this bodhicitta, immeasurable masses of beings—countless multitudes throughout the three times—are able to progress along the path of awakening.\n\nབདེ་མཆོག་བདེ་བླག་ཉིད་དུ་ཐོབ་པར་བྱེད། །\nThis generation of the mind enables beings to easily attain supreme bliss (unsurpassed enlightenment) without depending on difficult practices such as extreme austerities. It allows them to proceed effortlessly on a pleasant path 'from happiness to happiness,' as explained elsewhere: 'Who would become discouraged on the journey that proceeds from happiness to happiness, when one understands the mind?'",
    "<1><12> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'If one wishes to overcome the hundreds of sufferings of existence' refers to the desire to eliminate the multitude of sufferings in cyclic existence—birth, aging, sickness, death, and so forth—and employing methods to accomplish this goal.\n\n'And desires to dispel the unhappiness of sentient beings' indicates the altruistic wish, characteristic of those with great capacity, to remove all present and future sufferings experienced by all other living beings.\n\n'And also wishes to experience hundreds of various happinesses' points to the aspiration for oneself and all others to enjoy the numerous forms of both temporary happiness (high rebirth) and ultimate happiness (definite goodness and enlightenment).\n\n'Should never abandon bodhicitta itself' emphasizes that one should never discard or let deteriorate this precious mind of enlightenment, as it is the supreme method for accomplishing all these desires. One should maintain bodhicitta continuously in one's mindstream because it is certain that through bodhicitta alone, all these aims will be fulfilled.\n\nWhen this precious bodhicitta arises in one's mindstream—regardless of one's gender, age, or status—at that very moment, beings previously bound by karma and afflictions in samsara are transformed, becoming known as 'children of the Sugatas' or 'bodhisattvas,' worthy of veneration even by gods and humans, and respected by the Buddhas themselves.",
    "<1><13> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nབྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་སྐྱེས་གྱུར་ན་སྐད་ཅིག་གིས། (When bodhicitta arises, in an instant,)\nWhen this precious bodhicitta—both in its aspiring and engaging forms—arises in one's mindstream, it occurs in a single instant. This transformative moment happens regardless of whether one's body is male or female, age is old or young, or lineage is high or low. One should strive to generate this bodhicitta, as it brings immediate benefits.\n\nའཁོར་བའི་བཙོན་རར་བསྡམས་པའི་ཉམ་ཐག་རྣམས། (Those wretched beings bound in the prison of saṃsāra,)\nThis line refers to those miserable beings who were previously bound in the prison of saṃsāra by the iron chains of karma and afflictions. These beings are described as 'wretched' (ཉམ་ཐག) because they are fettered by their own karma and negative emotions, trapped in the cycle of suffering.\n\nབདེ་གཤེགས་རྣམས་ཀྱི་སྲས་ཞེས་བརྗོད་བྱ་ཞིང་། (Are called 'children of the Sugatas,')\nUpon generating bodhicitta, these beings undergo an immediate transformation of their status and name. They become known and proclaimed as 'children of the Sugatas' (བདེ་གཤེགས་རྣམས་ཀྱི་སྲས), adorned with this crown-like title of 'bodhisattva.' This illustrates how the inferior is transformed into the supreme, similar to the analogy of a gold-transforming elixir that turns base metal into gold.\n\nའཇིག་རྟེན་ལྷ་མིར་བཅས་པས་ཕྱག་བྱར་འགྱུར། (And become worthy of prostrations from worldly beings including gods and humans.)\nTheir status is so elevated that they become worthy of prostrations, offerings, and reverence from worldly beings including gods and humans. Even those who have just generated bodhicitta immediately obtain this benefit of being an object of respect, with joined palms. Moreover, even the Blessed Buddhas show respect to bodhisattvas, for it is said that bodhicitta is the guru of all Buddhas. This is not a quality exclusive to bodhisattvas dwelling on the high grounds but applies to anyone who genuinely generates bodhicitta.",
    "<1><14> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nLike the supreme form of the alchemical elixir that transmutes into gold, taking this impure body and transforming it into the precious, priceless form of the Victorious One (Buddha), you should firmly grasp what is called bodhicitta. Here, bodhicitta (the mind of awakening) is compared to an alchemical elixir, with the shared quality being the ability to transform something inferior into something excellent.\n\nThe Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra describes a type of mercury called 'that which appears as gold,' which can transform a thousand ounces of iron into gold with just a single ounce. Similarly, instead of rejecting this impure body composed of many unclean substances as the Śrāvakas do, when one willingly accepts it for the benefit of others across many lifetimes and infuses it with bodhicitta, it can be transformed into the Buddha's body.\n\nThis transformation turns our ordinary form into a wish-fulfilling jewel endowed with immeasurable precious qualities that protects from all the miseries of existence and peace, and accomplishes the two benefits (for self and others) in their perfection. The Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra further states that 'the mercury-like element of generating the mind toward omniscience, when held by the wisdom that completely dedicates the roots of virtue, exhausts all the iron of karmic and afflictive obscurations, turning all phenomena into the color of omniscience.'\n\nTherefore, one should firmly maintain this exceptional elixir called 'bodhicitta' without wavering, as instructed. This is what one must personally commit to uphold. Second, through the metaphor of a precious jewel, bodhicitta is shown to be difficult to find and of great value.",
    "<1><15> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe sole captain who guides all beings—the unrivaled Buddha—possesses immeasurable intelligence that pervades all objects of knowledge, beyond the measure of others.\n\nWhen this immeasurable intelligence thoroughly examines all phenomena over countless eons, just as a skilled captain leads merchants to treasure islands, the Buddha discovers that bodhicitta (the mind of enlightenment) is most precious due to its rarity and immense benefits.\n\nAs stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'Just as the wish-fulfilling jewel is considered the most precious among all treasures, similarly, all the roots of virtue—both contaminated and uncontaminated—of all gods, humans, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas cannot match the value of the precious jewel of bodhicitta.'\n\nTherefore, those who wish to be freed from the abodes of samsara—all aspects of worldly decline and the realms of suffering—should properly generate this precious bodhicitta jewel and hold it firmly in their mindstreams.\n\nThis means maintaining bodhicitta with complete preparation, main practice, and conclusion, steadfastly preserving it through mindfulness, awareness, and conscientiousness so that it does not deteriorate, as it is the supreme method that leads to the attainment of Buddhahood.",
    "<1><16> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nདགེ་བ་གཞན་ཀུན་ཆུ་ཤིང་བཞིན་དུ་ནི། །\n(All other virtuous actions are like plantain trees)\n\nThis verse compares all virtuous actions not embraced by bodhicitta to plantain (or banana) trees. Just as the trunk of a plantain tree bears fruit only once and then becomes exhausted, similarly all other kinds of merit not embraced by bodhicitta will eventually be depleted after ripening. These virtuous actions that accord with ordinary merit will produce temporary fruits such as higher rebirth but then become exhausted.\n\nའབྲས་བུ་བསྐྱེད་ནས་ཟད་པར་འགྱུར་བ་ཉིད། །\n(After bearing fruit, they become exhausted)\n\nAfter producing their results, these ordinary virtuous actions are depleted, just as the plantain tree dies after bearing fruit. Even the spiritual accomplishments of Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas ultimately reach a state where their aggregates become extinguished without remainder, as they lack the inexhaustible quality that bodhicitta provides.\n\nབྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་ཀྱི་ལྗོན་ཤིང་རྟག་པར་ཡང་། །\n(But the tree of bodhicitta constantly)\n\nIn contrast, virtuous actions embraced by bodhicitta are compared to excellent wish-fulfilling trees. The Precious Casket Sūtra explains: 'Mañjuśrī, it is like this: various trees grow and flourish when sustained by the four elements. Likewise, when the roots of virtue are embraced by the mind of enlightenment and dedicated to omniscience, they flourish and increase.'\n\nའབྲས་བུ་འབྱིན་པས་མི་ཟད་འཕེལ་བར་འགྱུར། །\n(Produces fruit without exhaustion and continues to increase)\n\nThe tree of bodhicitta constantly and continuously yields the ripened fruit of temporary excellent happiness for gods and humans, which is never exhausted. The fruit increases progressively and ultimately produces the vast results counted among the merit accumulations of the Buddha's form body. As stated in the Akṣayamati-nirdeśa Sūtra: 'Just as water droplets that fall into the great ocean are not exhausted until the end of the kalpa, likewise virtuous deeds dedicated to enlightenment are not exhausted until the attainment of the essence of enlightenment.' This is the fourth point illustrating the benefits of bodhicitta.",
    "<1><17> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nསྡིག་པ་ཤིན་ཏུ་མི་བཟད་བྱས་ན་ཡང་། །\nEven if one has committed extremely unbearable negative actions such as abandoning the Dharma, harming the Three Jewels, or committing the five heinous acts that would certainly lead to experiencing the sufferings of the Avīci hell,\n\nདཔའ་ལ་བརྟེན་ནས་འཇིགས་པ་ཆེན་པོ་ལྟར། །\njust as a criminal who has committed terrible deeds might be protected from great dangers by relying on a brave escort or hero (like a person who has killed someone's father seeking protection from a powerful person against the vengeful son),\n\nགང་ལ་བརྟེན་ནས་ཡུད་ཀྱིས་སྒྲོལ་འགྱུར་བ། །\nsimilarly, by relying on the precious bodhicitta, one will be swiftly liberated in an instant from the ripening effects of those great negative actions—the sufferings of lower rebirths and hell realms,\n\nདེ་ལ་བག་ཅན་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་ཅིས་མི་བརྟེན། །\nso why would those who are conscientious about observing what should be adopted and rejected, and who fear negative actions, not rely on this bodhicitta? As stated in the Teaching of Inexhaustible Intelligence (Akṣayamatinirdeśa): 'Son of noble family, it is like this: One who relies on a brave person is not afraid of any enemies. Similarly, a bodhisattva who properly relies on the brave person who has generated bodhicitta is not afraid of any enemies of wrongdoing.' This is the fifth point, illustrating how bodhicitta, like fire, destroys sin from its root.",
    "<1><18> Combined Commentary\n\nThis bodhicitta, like the fire at the end of an eon, completely burns all great sins in a single moment. Just as the fire at the end of a kalpa instantly burns the physical world up to the first meditation level without leaving even ashes, similarly this bodhicitta definitely burns away or purifies in a single instant great negativities such as the five heinous crimes, leaving no karmic residue to be experienced. As stated in the Gandavyuha Sutra: 'It is like the fire of the kalpa that burns all misdeeds.'\n\nIf one objects that two benefits from a single generation of bodhicitta would be contradictory, this is not the case. When increasingly superior forms of bodhicitta are attained, increasingly superior benefits arise in sequence. If bodhicitta can destroy the potency of karma that would definitely be experienced, what need is there to mention those of uncertain ripening?\n\nThe immeasurable and limitless benefits of this bodhicitta cannot be fathomed by the intellect. These boundless benefits were explained by Lord Maitreya, the great regent of the Buddhas, endowed with wisdom, to the noble youth Sudhana through numerous examples. According to the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra, Sudhana, son of the merchant Mahāpradīpa from the city Kyidpai Jungné, generated bodhicitta in the presence of Noble Mañjuśrī. Mañjuśrī directed him to seek spiritual friends, and after relying upon many teachers, he finally reached the southern shore of the ocean where Bodhisattva Maitreya resided.\n\nUpon seeing Sudhana, Venerable Maitreya addressed his assembly: 'Look at this one with perfectly pure intention, Sudhana, son of the merchant of wealth, who searches for the supreme bodhisattva conduct and has come to me, the wise one. Have you arrived well, you who have developed compassion and love? Have you arrived well in this vast maṇḍala of love? Have you arrived well, you who are so peaceful to behold? Were you not exhausted during your difficult practices?'\n\nAfter Sudhana requested teachings, Maitreya extensively taught the benefits of bodhicitta, saying: 'Son of good family, bodhicitta is like a seed that produces all the qualities of Buddhahood. It is like a field that increases all virtuous qualities of all beings. It is like the earth upon which the entire world rests. It is like Vaishravana in completely cutting off all poverty. It is like a father in fully protecting all bodhisattvas. It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel in accomplishing all purposes. It is like an excellent vase that fulfills all aspirations. It is like a short spear that defeats the enemy of afflictions,' and countless other distinct benefits.\n\nAmong these many benefits, the principal ones are: attaining Buddhahood, increasing virtue, and purifying negativities. Bodhicitta can be divided into conventional bodhicitta arising from symbolic understanding and ultimate bodhicitta attained through realization of the true nature of phenomena. As Maitreya explains, bodhicitta arises from meeting virtuous spiritual friends, awakening one's Buddha-nature, developing compassion, hearing profound teachings, and accumulating merit through familiarity with virtue.",
    "<1><19> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དེ་མདོར་བསྡུས་ན།' (That bodhicitta, in brief,)\nThis verse introduces bodhicitta, the awakened mind that arises from the power of meditation. Bodhicitta is the precious mind that seeks enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings. While bodhicitta can be classified in multiple ways—from one to six divisions, twenty-two types according to the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, or eighty inexhaustible types according to the Sāgaramati-paripṛcchā Sūtra—the text is about to provide us with the most essential classification.\n\n'རྣམ་པ་གཉིས་སུ་ཤེས་བྱ་སྟེ།' (is to be understood as having two aspects.)\nWhen summarized according to its nature, bodhicitta should be understood as having two fundamental aspects. This division is the most essential way to comprehend the different manifestations of bodhicitta. As stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'Those sentient beings who aspire to unsurpassed enlightenment are indeed rare. Even rarer are those who actually engage in unsurpassed enlightenment.'\n\n'བྱང་ཆུབ་སྨོན་པའི་སེམས་དང་ནི།' (The aspirational mind of enlightenment and)\nThe first type is aspirational bodhicitta, which is the mind that focuses on and wishes to attain supreme enlightenment for the sake of others. The mere aspirational mind generation can arise without depending on a ritual, but when fortified by a commitment to never abandon this mind until attaining Buddhahood, it is formally received through ritual, as taught in the instructions of Lord Atiśa.\n\n'བྱང་ཆུབ་འཇུག་པ་ཉིད་ཡིན་ནོ།' (the engaged [mind of] enlightenment itself.)\nThe second type is engaged bodhicitta, which is the mind that actually engages in the conduct that leads to enlightenment. This is more rare and profound than aspirational bodhicitta. Both aspirational and engaged bodhicitta can exist even before attaining the special path of accumulation, though their full manifestation develops as one progresses along the path. The distinction between these two types is essential for understanding how one progresses from merely wishing for enlightenment to actively engaging in the practices that lead to it.",
    "<1><20> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nའགྲོ་བར་འདོད་དང་འགྲོ་བ་ཡི། །བྱེ་བྲག་ཇི་ལྟར་ཤེས་པ་ལྟར། །དེ་བཞིན་མཁས་པས་འདི་གཉིས་ཀྱི། །བྱེ་བྲག་རིམ་བཞིན་ཤེས་པར་བྱ། །\n\nJust as when a person desires to go to a particular place but is not yet physically moving (like when lying down while thinking 'I will go there'), this differs from actually setting out on the path and physically going there (lifting and placing the feet). Though both minds share the thought of 'going to that place,' they differ in whether one is engaged in the actual act. Similarly, the wise bodhisattvas should understand the distinction between these two types of bodhicitta—aspiration and engagement—in their proper sequence.\n\nThe aspiring bodhicitta is the commitment with two components: wishing to attain perfect buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings and actively seeking this resultant state. It is the intention to achieve Buddhahood for the benefit of others without necessarily depending on engaging in practices such as generosity and the other perfections. The engaging bodhicitta, on the other hand, involves committing to practice the causal path of the six perfections and actually engaging in their practice—it necessarily depends on such practices.\n\nThere are various interpretations of this distinction among masters. Some like Jñānapāda distinguish between ordinary and noble beings' mind generation; others like Abhaya and Jñānakīrti differentiate based on the stages of the path; Śāntipa and others focus on whether one has taken the formal vow; while Lord Atisha maintained that aspirational bodhicitta focuses on the resultant state of buddhahood while engaging bodhicitta focuses on the causal path.\n\nDespite being conceptually distinct, aspiration and engagement are one in essence. As illustrated in Noble Maitreya's Vimokṣa, even a broken vajra jewel outshines gold ornaments and dispels poverty—likewise, even the mere aspiration toward omniscience surpasses the qualities of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and bears the name 'bodhisattva.'",
    "<1><21> Combined Commentary on 'The Aspiring and Engaging Bodhichitta'\n\nFrom the mind that aspires to awakening (bodhipraṇidhicitta), great results will arise while one remains in samsara, such as the perfect power and sovereignty of gods like Brahma and Indra, or human universal monarchs (cakravartin). As stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'Son of good family, it is like this: for example, even if a precious vajra is broken, it still outshines all exceptional gold ornaments, and it does not lose the name 'precious vajra.' Similarly, son of good family, even if the precious vajra of generating the mind aimed at omniscience lacks diligence, it still outshines all the golden ornaments of the qualities of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, does not lose the name 'bodhisattva,' and dispels all the poverty of samsara.'\n\nHowever, unlike the engaged mind (prasthānacitta), merit or virtuous actions such as generosity, ethical discipline, and so forth do not arise continuously without interruption from the aspirational mind alone.\n\nFrom the time one takes the engaged mind properly with the determination not to turn back, thinking: 'For the sake of liberating the infinite and limitless realm of sentient beings from the suffering of existence and peace, and for the attainment of Buddhahood, I commit to practicing the six perfections,' and protects it without deterioration, from that moment onward, even when that person is asleep or engaged in play or other heedless activities, the force of merit such as generosity and so forth will arise abundantly, inexhaustibly, and continuously without interruption, equal to space itself, beyond measure.\n\nNevertheless, if after taking the bodhisattva vow of engagement, one does not practice generosity and so forth even occasionally and minimally, not only will virtue not increase, but one will incur the great fault of a root downfall of not engaging in virtue, as has been taught.",
    "<1><22> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFrom the moment one genuinely takes up the mind of engagement (bodhichitta of application) with an irreversible determination to liberate the infinite realm of sentient beings from samsara, a continuous stream of merit begins. This verse describes the critical transition when a practitioner moves beyond mere aspiration to actual engagement.\n\n'From the time when...' refers to that pivotal moment of genuine commitment, marking when the benefits of bodhichitta fully activate. Unlike the mind of aspiration, which is merely a longing for enlightenment, this engagement mind involves an unwavering commitment to practice the six perfections.\n\n'For the sake of liberating the boundless realms of sentient beings' indicates the vast scope of the bodhisattva's intention - not limited to helping a few beings but extending to all sentient beings without exception across the infinite expanse of samsara.\n\n'With a non-retreating attitude' or 'resolve that will not turn back' highlights the unshakable quality of this commitment. This determination remains firm regardless of difficulties or the length of time required, continuing 'for as long as samsara endures.'\n\nWhen one 'genuinely takes up that mind,' a remarkable transformation occurs - even during sleep, intoxication, or periods of heedlessness, the momentum of merit continues to flow uninterruptedly, producing virtues as vast as space itself. However, this doesn't mean one can remain idle, as not engaging in virtuous actions like generosity would constitute a serious downfall for one who has taken such vows.",
    "<1><23> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFrom the time one properly takes up the engaged mind of bodhicitta (the mind of engagement) with the firm resolve not to turn back from the commitment to practice the six perfections for as long as saṃsāra lasts, in order to completely liberate the infinite realm of sentient beings from suffering and establish them on the ground of Buddhahood—from that moment onward, even when one is asleep or has become heedless through intoxication, play, or other such activities, the force of merit (virtuous actions such as generosity and moral discipline) will arise abundantly and continuously without interruption. This merit flows in manifold streams, equal in measure to space itself—vast, inexhaustible, and immeasurable.\n\nUnlike the aspiring mind of bodhicitta, which is merely a wish for the result and does not generate virtue continuously, the engaged mind is accompanied by the actual practice that accomplishes the complete causes of Buddhahood. When this intention is properly maintained without corruption, the flow of merit continues uninterruptedly even during states of unconsciousness or distraction. However, it is important to note that if after taking the bodhisattva vow of engagement, one fails to apply oneself to virtuous practices even occasionally and in small measure, not only will one's virtue fail to increase, but one will incur the grave fault of a root downfall by not engaging in virtue.\n\nThe explanation for why these extraordinary benefits arise will be established through two approaches: through scriptural authority and through logical reasoning.

The Tathāgata elaborated these teachings with four kinds of reasoning to establish the validity of these benefits, covering: the immeasurable number of sentient beings as objects, the varieties of suffering to be removed, the qualities of buddhahood to be attained, and the duration in terms of eons.\n\n**དམན་མོས་སེམས་ཅན་དོན་གྱི་ཕྱིར། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པ་ཉིད་ཀྱིས་གསུངས། །**\nThe Tathāgata himself taught this for the sake of beings with inferior motivation—specifically certain śrāvakas of undetermined lineage who fear the accumulation of vast merit and have turned away from the Mahāyāna, pursuing instead the śrāvaka path. The Buddha's purpose was to guide these beings of lesser inclination toward the Mahāyāna by revealing the immense qualities and benefits of bodhicitta.\n\nAs quoted in the sūtra: 'If I don armor for the sake of benefiting and bringing happiness to immeasurable hosts of sentient beings, then even when I am unmindful or asleep, the immeasurable roots of virtue directed toward the welfare and happiness of all sentient beings will increase, expand, and become perfectly complete in every moment of mind, day and night.'\n\nThe benefits of bodhicitta can be established through reasoning in two parts: the benefits of the aspirational mind of awakening and the benefits of the engaged mind of awakening. The aspirational bodhicitta brings great benefits because the virtuous activity is limitless, there is no other altruistic mind superior to it, and such an altruistic intention has not arisen even for their own sake among ordinary sentient beings.",

Any sentient being who generates malice in their heart toward such a noble Bodhisattva—one who bestows all benefit and happiness and serves as the ultimate patron—commits an extremely serious offense. The Buddha has taught that the person who harbors such malicious thoughts will dwell in the hell realms for as many kalpas as the number of moments in which they generated ill will. This is explicitly stated in the Sutra of the Magical Display that Determines Perfect Peace (also called the Sutra of the Magical Display that Thoroughly Pacifies), which declares: 'Manjushri, a being who feels anger or contempt toward a Bodhisattva should prepare to wear the armor of hell-dwelling for as many kalpas as the moments of anger they generated.' The measure of time here is precisely defined: if a strong person snaps their fingers, and that duration is divided into sixty-four parts, one such part is considered the smallest moment of time. The Sutra of the Seal of Engaging in the Generation of the Power of Faith further emphasizes the severity of this offense, stating that generating ill will toward a Bodhisattva who has faith in the Mahāyāna produces immeasurably greater sin than destroying or burning stūpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River.

The merit generated through genuine faith in a bodhisattva will increase much more significantly than the previously explained consequences of negative actions, leading to experiences like the happiness of the Tuṣita gods and other extensive results.\n\nརྒྱལ་སྲས་རྣམས་ལ་དོ་གལ་ཆེན་པོས་ཀྱང་། །\nFor the great bodhisattva children of the Conqueror, even under great duress—facing hardships such as lack of food and clothing, death of loved ones, loss of possessions, illness, attacks from enemies and demons, or other major adverse conditions—no matter how severe these may be, they remain steadfast. As stated in the Condensed Perfections: 'Even when subjected to various unbearable harms, these superior beings' minds remain unchanged.'\n\nསྡིག་པ་མི་འབྱུང་དགེ་བ་ངང་གིས་འཕེལ། །\nBecause bodhisattvas are individuals who transform bad omens into good fortune and adverse conditions into allies, negative actions do not arise in their mindstream, even at the cost of their lives. Instead, through the power of such challenging conditions, their virtuous qualities such as renunciation, love, and compassion naturally increase more and more. Unlike those weak in courage who become ordinary when faced with adversity, bodhisattvas with stable minds transform obstacles into aids for accomplishing awakening, just as wind can intensify a forest fire rather than extinguish it.",
    "<1><40> Combined Commentary Explanation of the Source Text\n\nI prostrate to the bodies of those in whom that excellent precious jewel of bodhicitta has arisen, showing great respect through the three doors of body, speech, and mind. This verse expresses reverence for any being—whether superior or inferior—who has generated this supreme precious mind of awakening.\n\nI take refuge in those bodhisattvas who are the source of happiness, for even when one causes harm to them, they still connect the harm-doer with happiness. This remarkable quality is illustrated in Jātaka tales like those of the patient sage and King Maitryabala (Kṣāntibala), where even though five yakṣas drank his blood, he ultimately established them in the noble state.\n\nThere is no contradiction between the earlier statement that generating ill-will toward bodhisattvas leads to rebirth in hell and the claim here that harming them connects one with happiness. The former refers to the unfailing law of cause and effect, while the latter shows how bodhisattvas, through their compassion, bodhicitta, skillful means, and powerful aspirations, eventually care for those who harm them both immediately and in the long term.\n\nThe gateway to entering the Mahāyāna path, whether through Tantra or Pāramitā, is bodhicitta itself. To generate it, one must first genuinely appreciate its benefits, which include both temporary benefits (avoiding lower realms, taking higher rebirth) and ultimate benefits (liberation and omniscience).\n\nHaving understood the qualities of those who possess bodhicitta, we should confess whatever misdeeds we have committed toward bodhisattvas, resolve not to repeat them, and take refuge in them. It is crucial not to look at the faults of sentient beings but to cultivate pure perception toward them, recognizing that even those with faults can progress toward buddhahood through practice.\n\nHow amazing that some remain in the darkness of ignorance with their mind's eye fixed on the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism, unable to see this bodhicitta endowed with a thousand rays of light that dispels all darkness of the two obscurations!",
    "<1><41> Combined Commentary on Chapter One\n\nThus ends the first chapter, entitled 'Explanation of the Benefits of Bodhicitta from the Introduction to the Conduct of Bodhisattvas.'\n\nI prostrate respectfully with my three doors of body, speech, and mind to the embodiments of those in whom this supreme jewel of bodhicitta has arisen. Among all mental concepts of superior and inferior persons, the precious bodhicitta is the supreme remedy that dispels all miseries of both existence and peace.\n\nAs illustrated in the chapter on patience and exemplified by tales such as the sage who proclaimed patience and King Maitrībala (Kṣāntibala), even when five yakṣas drank the blood from his body, he still led them to the noble state. Through the power of compassion, bodhicitta, skillful means, and aspirations, bodhisattvas connect even those who harm them with both temporary and ultimate happiness. Therefore, I take refuge in those noble beings, the bodhisattvas, who are the source of all happiness in this and future lives.\n\nIf one asks whether there is a contradiction between the statement that 'harboring ill will toward bodhisattvas leads to rebirth in hell' and the assertion that 'harming them leads to happiness,' there is no contradiction. The former refers to the unerring law of karma, whereby ill will immediately causes rebirth in hell, while the latter refers to how bodhisattvas, through their compassion and powerful aspirations, eventually take care of such beings.\n\nThe benefits of bodhicitta can be summarized as two: temporary and ultimate. The temporary benefits include not falling into lower realms and taking rebirth in higher realms. When bodhicitta arises, it purifies previously accumulated causes of lower rebirth, prevents future accumulation of such causes, increases previously accumulated causes of higher rebirth, and generates inexhaustible new positive causes. The ultimate benefits of liberation and omniscience are also easily accomplished through reliance on this mind.\n\nWhether one enters the path of mantra or pāramitā, since bodhicitta itself is the gateway to entering the Mahāyāna, one must strive through many methods to generate this mind. To do so, one must first meditate on the benefits of bodhicitta until sincere enthusiasm increases, and practice the seven limbs along with taking refuge.\n\nTibet is said to be the domain of noble Avalokiteśvara and inhabited by those predisposed to Mahāyāna. Therefore, we must cultivate pure perception toward all beings, not focusing on their faults. It is taught that, just as Indian Brahmins who worship the moon prostrate to the waxing moon rather than the full moon, so should one prostrate to bodhisattvas. Even if they have faults, these are conditioned phenomena that will be exhausted through meditation on the path.\n\nWise ones who have obtained this precious human body with its freedoms and endowments should diligently cultivate the two aspects of bodhicitta. This is the supreme way to extract the essence from this precious human support. Therefore, first diligently meditate on the benefits of this mind."

Within the immeasurable palace setting, these golden lotuses form the foundation for the next offering element.\n\n**རིན་ཆེན་སྒྲོན་མེ་རྣམས་ཀྱང་དབུལ་བར་བགྱི། །** (I shall offer jeweled lamps as well)\nUpon these golden lotus heaps, I offer various jeweled lamps made of beryl and other precious substances. These lamps radiate brilliant light that pervades Jambudvīpa and other realms, continuously illuminating day and night. In one's personal visualization, the lamp bowls are the size of a great trichiliocosm, the lamp stems are like Mount Meru, and the butter is like the great oceans, with five-colored light pervading the entire space element.

These parasols are made of various divine fabrics and precious materials that are extremely beautiful, with their handles crafted from pure gold. Around their circumference, they are adorned with pleasing ornamental forms such as pearls and various precious jewels arranged in auspicious patterns like the glorious knot, lattice designs, and half-lattice designs. These parasols possess excellent shapes that are lovely to behold and delightful to the eye. In the visualization, they are held raised aloft by offering goddesses, swift horses, elephants, and other divine beings. Just as in the Buddha's time when the compassionate One was offered five hundred beryl parasols from the right side by Brahma and five hundred gold parasols made from Jambu River gold from the left side by Indra, the practitioner makes the aspiration: 'I shall continuously offer these to the mighty sages (the Buddhas).' Through making such offerings, one should contemplate: 'May all sentient beings, myself and others, be protected from the burning heat of samsara and lower realms, and may they find shelter in the cool shade of the Three Jewels.' This verse constitutes the fourth of the categories of offerings described in this section of the prayer.",

These offerings include pleasant melodious songs with dance, like the sound of the kinnara tree that made Mahakashyapa unable to resist dancing, or like the melodious strumming of the lute of Gandharva King Rabga, accompanied by dance and praise. These sounds are pleasing to the ear and, by their special power, merely by being heard, relieve, dispel, or pacify the suffering of sentient beings, bringing them soothing joy and cooling their minds. They are referred to as 'clouds' due to their all-pervasive nature. May these innumerable melodious sounds pervade all the buddha-fields of the ten directions, arising before the Victorious Ones and their heirs, and may they continuously remain distinct without interruption—this is the aspiration.",
    "<2><21> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**May a continuous rain of jewels, flowers, and other offerings fall incessantly upon all the sublime Dharma treasures, upon stupas and images.**\n\nThis prayer aspires that all sacred Dharma treasures—both scriptural and realized—together with their physical manifestations in texts and books, receive constant offerings. The 'precious and holy Dharma' refers to the twelve branches of the Buddha's teachings and the Dharma Jewel encompassing cessation and path. Just as when the Buddha and Bodhisattvas teach the Dharma and miraculous flower rains appear, may such offerings occur whenever the scriptural Dharma is taught and studied. And just as the pure realm deities showered flowers when the Blessed Buddha attained perfect enlightenment, may offerings similarly rain down whenever the realized Dharma arises in one's mindstream.\n\nMay offerings shower upon all types of stupas representing the Buddha's eight activities, including: the Lotus Mound Stupa built by Śuddhodana in Kapilavastu at the Buddha's birth; the Māra-Subjugating or Enlightenment Stupa erected at Bodhgaya; the Auspicious Many-Doored Stupa built by the five ascetics at Varanasi when the wheel of Dharma was turned; the Miracle Stupa constructed by the Licchavis in Jetavana Grove; the Descent from Heaven Stupa; the Reconciliation Stupa; and the Victorious and Parinirvana Stupas.\n\nAs stated in the Bhadrakalpika Sutra, 'The Buddha's relics will multiply,' offerings should rain upon stupas containing the Buddha's relics throughout the world, including those built by King Ashoka throughout Jambudvipa and sacred stupas in Tibet such as the white stupa at Samye containing relics miraculously brought by the second Buddha of Oddiyana.\n\nMay offerings shower upon all images—painted, cast, or sculpted—including the first cloth painting authorized by the Buddha himself, precious jeweled images made by master craftsmen, the Jowo Śākyamuni, and the three supports of the teachings from the Vajrayāna tradition.\n\nUpon all these, may various precious substances, flowers, fragrances, and other offerings continuously rain down without interruption for as long as samsara exists. If one's discipline is completely pure, such aspirations will be actually fulfilled. This forms the section concerning unsurpassable offerings.",
    "<2><22> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra and other great bodhisattvas make offerings to the Victorious Ones, in the same way I shall offer to the Tathāgata protectors together with their heirs.\n\nThese noble bodhisattvas who have attained mastery, such as Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra, manifest offering substances that fill the entire sky according to their wishes. The Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, for example, emanated hundreds of thousands of multicolored light rays from his heart, equal in number to the atoms in countless Buddha realms. At the tip of each light ray appeared a replica of Samantabhadra himself, with each emanation creating further emanations infinitely.\n\nAs described in the Ratnolka-dhāraṇī: 'Having expanded rays of light from a canopy of flowers, a display of flowers, and with various flowers scattered everywhere, those great beings made offerings to the Victorious Ones.' The Ratnamegha Sūtra similarly states: 'Having displayed mostly flowers, canopies of flowers, and emanating arrays of flower-light, having scattered various flowers everywhere, these great beings make offerings to the Victorious Ones.'\n\nJust as these tenth-bhūmi Bodhisattvas make magical offering clouds of limitless extent to the perfectly enlightened Buddhas of the ten directions, likewise I too shall make offerings to the Tathāgata protectors—the guides and guardians of gods and humans—together with their spiritual heirs. Furthermore, generating bodhicitta, cultivating compassion, and retaining the words and meaning of the Dharma are also unsurpassable offerings, so one must engage in these practices as well.",
    "<2><23> Combined Commentary\n\nI praise the oceans of qualities—the Buddha Blessed Ones who possess ocean-like qualities such as the physical marks and characteristics, melodious Brahma-voice, omniscient mind, wisdom, compassion, and other limitless qualities, along with their spiritual heirs, the assembly of bodhisattvas.\n\nI praise them with oceans of melodious expressions of praise—with limitless elements of vocal modulation and praising melodies that express their infinite virtues. Here, 'melody' refers to speech, while 'limbs' refers to its causes, and 'ocean' signifies multiplicity of sounds. This praise is offered by imagining that each body has countless heads, and each head has countless tongues capable of limitless expressions.\n\nMay these sweet clouds of melodious praises definitely arise everywhere and at all times in the presence of those oceans of qualities—the Victorious Ones and their heirs—continuously throughout all times and ways, even without my offering such praise. This completes this aspiration.\n\nSecond is the branch of prostration, which has three parts: paying homage to the Three Jewels, to the foundation for generating bodhicitta, and to the preceptors, teachers, and others.",

    "<2><25> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'I bow to the foundations of the awakening mind' refers to Buddha statues, Mahāyāna scriptures, the birthplace of the Teacher, places where bodhicitta is generated, and where Dharma is taught and studied. These are the causes from which the awakening mind arises and the bases for its development.\n\n'I also bow to all stūpas' means I prostrate to all support objects of Buddha's body, speech, and mind, and to all stūpas, however many there may be, which serve as foundations where this awakening mind is generated, cultivated, or taught.\n\n'Likewise to the preceptor' refers to the abbot who completes the earlier and later words of the Prātimokṣa ordination, as well as those who receive permission to give it. These are the preceptors from whom we receive the Dharma.\n\n'And to the teacher' indicates the masters who provide instruction for novices and fully ordained monks, and those who teach reading and so forth. They are the spiritual teachers who guide us on the path.\n\n'And to those with excellent disciplined conduct' refers to those who have relinquished earlier [habits] and engaged in the latter [discipline]—those who shoulder the burden of the supreme disciplined conduct that strives for the path to liberation. This includes both white-robed laypeople with long hair and ordained renunciants in saffron robes who follow the Teacher.\n\nThe meaning of taking refuge, which this verse introduces, is to mentally grasp and verbally express reliance on that which liberates from fear and suffering. It includes both causal refuge (taking the already established Three Jewels as sources of liberation) and resultant refuge (taking the Buddha and Dharma Jewels to be attained in one's own continuum).",
    "<2><26> Combined Commentary Explanation: Line by Line\n\n**'Until reaching the essence of enlightenment,' (བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོར་མཆིས་ཀྱི་བར། །)**\n\nThis line establishes the duration of refuge. It means 'from this time onwards until reaching the essence of unsurpassed awakening'—that is, until manifesting the dharmakāya at the foot of the bodhi tree. Just as all Buddhas of the three times attained enlightenment under their respective Bodhi trees, so too I take refuge until I externally attain perfect enlightenment, and internally, until I directly realize the nature of Buddha-essence (tathāgatagarbha) in its entirety. This differs from worldly refuge-taking, which is temporary, and Hinayana refuge-taking, which lasts for one's lifetime. In the Mahayana tradition, refuge is taken until complete Buddhahood is achieved.\n\n**'I go for refuge to all the Buddhas,' (སངས་རྒྱས་རྣམས་ལ་སྐྱབས་སུ་མཆིས། །)**\n\nHere one takes refuge in all the Buddhas endowed with the four kayas and five wisdoms as teachers who show the path. As Maitreya described, the Buddha has the qualities of being unconditioned, spontaneously accomplished, and realized through self-cognizing wisdom rather than external conditions (perfection of one's own purpose). Additionally, the Buddha perceives all phenomena as they are and in their entirety, possesses great compassion without conceptualization, and has the power to liberate beings from suffering (perfection of others' purpose). Saying 'I go for refuge' means 'I rely on you—please protect me.'\n\n**'To the Dharma and to the assembly of Bodhisattvas,' (ཆོས་དང་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའ་ཡི། །)**\n\nI take refuge in the sublime Dharma, which embodies both scriptural and realized teachings—the Truth of Cessation (beyond conceptualization, non-dual, free from elaboration) and the Truth of the Path (pure, luminous, the perfect antidote to afflictions). For beginners, the Dharma is the actual refuge, as the Buddha stated: 'I have shown you the methods of liberation; liberation depends on your own efforts.' I also take refuge in the assembly of Bodhisattvas, the noble Sangha, who possess direct perception of reality, perception of Buddha-nature in all beings, and self-cognizing wisdom, along with freedom from afflictive obscurations, knowledge obscurations, and attachment to self-interest.\n\n**'Likewise I go for refuge.' (ཚོགས་ལའང་དེ་བཞིན་སྐྱབས་སུ་མཆི། །)**\n\nJust as I took refuge in the Buddhas, likewise I take refuge in the precious Dharma and in the assembly of Bodhisattvas, accepting them as the actual refuge and companions in accomplishing the path. This comprehensive refuge-taking plants the seed of liberation, establishes one in the Buddhist community, provides protection from fears, and leads to enlightenment. The Sūryagarbha Sūtra states: 'Those beings who take refuge in the Buddha cannot be killed by ten million maras. Even if their ethics degenerate and their minds become disturbed, they will definitely reach the other shore of existence.' Having taken refuge, one should maintain the precepts: not taking refuge in other deities, abandoning harm toward others, not aligning with non-Buddhists, and diligently making offerings to the Three Jewels.",

This indicates the omnipresence of the enlightened beings who will witness the confession.\n\n'རྫོགས་སངས་རྒྱས་དང་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས། །' (The perfectly awakened Buddhas and bodhisattvas)\nHere, the text specifically identifies the two main objects of confession: the perfectly awakened Blessed Buddhas and the bodhisattvas. These enlightened beings are the appropriate witnesses for confession because they have the power to understand and help purify negativities.\n\n'ཐུགས་རྗེ་ཆེན་པོ་མངའ་རྣམས་ལ། །' (Those who possess great compassion)\nThis line emphasizes the quality of great compassion (thugs rje chen po) that these enlightened beings possess, indicating why they are suitable recipients of confession. Their great compassion ensures they will respond with understanding rather than judgment to one's confession.\n\n'ཐལ་མོ་སྦྱར་ཏེ་གསོལ་བ་ནི། །' (With palms joined, I supplicate)\nThe final line describes the physical gesture (joining palms) and verbal action (supplication) that accompanies the confession. This represents the beginning of the confession process, which will involve the four powers: the power of remorse, the power of support, the power of applying remedies, and the power of restoration.",

I individually confess and acknowledge all these grave misdeeds to all the guides—the Buddhas together with their spiritual heirs.\n\nThe urgency of confession is emphasized because there is no certainty about when death will come, as its causes are unpredictable. There is no guarantee one will not die today itself. If death comes, one faces the suffering of the critical moment of death, followed by the suffering of the intermediate state, and then all the sufferings of lower realms in future lives. Since all these arise from the causes of sin and non-virtue, one should feel genuine remorse for past negative actions.\n\nThis verse represents the concise confession of negativities, which is followed by the explanation of taking refuge, divided into three parts: the reason for taking refuge, the objects in which one takes refuge, and the meaning of how one takes refuge.'",

    "<2><33> Combined Commentary\n\nThis unpredictable Lord of Death, who cannot be trusted even for a moment, is completely unreliable. He does not wait for what has been done or not done—whether we have finished our tasks or not, whether we have purified our misdeeds or not—and does not give us time to complete what we've started or begin what we've planned. \n\nTherefore, whether sick or healthy, no one can have confidence in their lifespan. As the saying goes, 'A hundred healthy people die during the lifetime of one chronically ill person.' Indeed, whoever one may be—whether living comfortably or not—there is no certainty that one will not suddenly die, just as sunlight between clouds or a butter lamp in the wind may be present one moment but suddenly vanish the next.\n\nFor this reason, one cannot rely on this life, meaning one should not establish confidence thinking, 'I certainly won't die today.' There is no certainty about when, where, or from what cause one will die, so there is no certainty that one won't die today itself. Since life is completely unreliable and death can come suddenly even before our lifespan is complete, we should swiftly purify our misdeeds and quickly seek refuge. As Nāgārjuna stated: 'This life, subject to many harms, is even more impermanent than a water bubble struck by wind. That one has the opportunity to awaken after falling asleep, inhaling and exhaling breath—this indeed is wondrous.'",

Not having understood this fundamental truth, I have committed various kinds of sins through attachment and hatred: for the sake of protecting and benefiting those dear to me (relatives and friends) and subduing and harming those who are not dear to me (enemies). However, all of this was utterly meaningless and is now a source of deep regret, as it is improper to commit sins for their sake when ultimately I must leave them all behind.",
    "<2><35> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n'Enemies who are not dear ones, even if not subjugated, will die and cease to exist.' This verse shows that all enemies for whose sake one has committed misdeeds will eventually cease to exist, passing away regardless of our efforts to overcome them.\n\n'And dear ones—friends and relatives—even if nurtured, will be of no benefit as all will die and cease to exist.' This points to the impermanence of even our closest relationships; despite our care and attachment, friends and relatives will also inevitably pass away, with no distinction in their ultimate fate.\n\n'Moreover, I myself will also die and cease to exist.' The verse then turns to one's own mortality, emphasizing that just like enemies and loved ones, we too are subject to the same impermanence.\n\n'Likewise, all will cease to exist.' This final line expands the scope to include everything—the external world-container (mountains, continents), all sentient beings (enemies, friends, and neutral beings), possessions, relatives, enjoyments, and everything else, regardless of how powerful, wealthy, or beautiful they may appear.\n\nThe overall message is that committing sins or misdeeds out of attachment to friends or aversion to enemies is ultimately meaningless, since everything is impermanent. Not even the slightest trust in the permanence of worldly relationships or possessions is appropriate, and one should feel remorse for having committed sins motivated by such attachments. The happiness of pleasing relatives in this life does not follow into the next life, making such efforts ultimately futile.",
    "<2><36> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**རྨི་ལམ་ཉམས་སུ་མྱོང་བ་བཞིན། །** (Just as one experiences [things] in a dream,)\nThis verse draws a parallel between our waking experiences and dream experiences. Just as when one experiences the five desirable sense objects such as forms and sounds in last night's dream, or experiences events like subduing enemies, protecting friends, or receiving gain and honor while dreaming, these experiences seem real during the dream state but become something else upon waking.\n\n**དངོས་པོ་གང་དང་གང་སྤྱད་པ། །** (Whatever objects one has enjoyed,)\nThis refers to all the activities from our earlier days—accepting and rejecting the five sense objects like forms and sounds, subduing enemies, protecting friends, engaging in commerce and agriculture, receiving gain and honor, acquiring fame, enjoying food, clothing, and possessions. Whatever objects one has mistakenly considered pleasurable and enjoyed in life, all of these will eventually transform.\n\n**དེ་དེ་དྲན་པའི་ཡུལ་དུ་འགྱུར། །** (Those become merely objects of memory,)\nJust as dream experiences become merely objects of memory when one awakens and are not actually seen anymore, similarly, all our life experiences only become objects of memory, as when one thinks, 'Today I experienced this and that.' At the time of death especially, all these experiences will become merely objects of memory with no tangible reality. Their benefits or harms can no longer be experienced directly.\n\n**འདས་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་མཐོང་མི་འགྱུར། །** (All that has passed will not be seen again.)\nEverything that has passed will not be seen again but will be exhausted as merely objects of memory. All past events that have already ceased cannot be seen now nor can they be experienced again because they are past. Therefore, pursuing worldly aims is ultimately meaningless, and one should repeatedly make the firm resolution to practice Dharma alone from this very moment onward.",
    "<2><37> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nEven leaving aside the enemies and friends from previous lives, the verse speaks of a profound truth: 'Even in this very present life while you are alive, numerous beloved ones and non-beloved ones have passed away.' This refers to the many people we once knew—both those we loved and those we disliked—who have already died during our lifetime, becoming merely objects of memory without any capacity to directly benefit or harm us. \n\nOne might mistakenly think, 'Then the negative deeds done for their sake have also passed and will not harm me,' but this is not the case. The verse states clearly: 'The unbearable ripening of negative karma performed for their sake stands before you.' The negative actions committed out of attachment to loved ones or aversion toward enemies will bear unbearable ripening results; these karmic imprints remain inseparable from you like your body and its shadow, waiting before you.\n\nAs stated in the Advice to the King: 'When a king departs due to the threat of time, neither retinue, possessions, nor relatives follow. Whatever birth a person takes, their karma follows them like a shadow.' The pleasure experienced in the company of these people was temporary, like a dream that does not return. However, the karmic consequences of evil deeds committed for their sake remain with us, as if waiting.\n\nJust as attendants prepare in advance to welcome important people, similarly, according to one's karmic appearances, those with negative karma will be met and led by Yama's attendants to lower realms, while those with positive karma will be welcomed to pure realms by deities and spiritual teachers. Therefore, one should repeatedly contemplate with remorse the negative actions committed for the sake of friends and enemies alike.",
    "<2><38> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Thus I am a visitor,' refers to the realization that we are merely temporary beings in this world, like a bee arriving later or a guest who suddenly appears without knowing where we came from or where we will go next. Because I did not understand this impermanent nature of myself—that I could die at any moment and that my life lasts but an instant—I remained ignorant about what to adopt and reject.\n\nBy not realizing that 'I am a mere passerby' in this life, I clung stubbornly to the notion of permanence, which is a fundamental delusion. This ignorance became the basis for my harmful actions.\n\nThrough the forces of delusion, attachment toward my own side and desired objects, and hatred toward others and unwanted situations, I have committed and accumulated many different kinds of sins such as killing, taking what is not given, and numerous other misdeeds.\n\nBecause of these negative actions, I have created the causes to fall into lower realms. There is no possibility of adding to one's lifespan while its diminishment continues uninterruptedly, and one dies carrying the burden of these negative actions. If I wish to be purified in this lifetime, I must quickly cleanse myself through genuine regret, contemplating the certainty of death, the uncertainty of when it will come, and how at the time of death nothing will benefit me except the Dharma.",
    "<2><39> Combined Commentary\n\nDay and night pass without pausing even for a moment, and this life is constantly diminishing. Like a pond cut off from its source, life is being consumed continuously without the opportunity to pause even for an instant. As it states in the source text, 'this life is constantly diminishing,' and since there is absolutely no additional time coming from elsewhere—no extension to one's lifespan—how could someone like myself not die? I will certainly die.\n\nEven if the king of physicians himself were to appear, when the projected lifespan is exhausted, there can be no extension to one's life. Since there is no increase to life coming from elsewhere, we beings in saṃsāra will certainly die, so one must strive to confess and purify negative actions.

However, even after desperately searching in this way in all directions...",
    "<2><46> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Having seen that there is no refuge in the four directions' refers to the terrifying moment when, approaching death or in the bardo state, one frantically searches in all directions without finding any protection or escape. Like Devadatta who lamented 'Gautama, alas! alas!' while descending into hell, one realizes that even the Buddha cannot save someone from experiencing the results of their own negative actions.\n\n'Then one becomes utterly discouraged' describes the complete despair that arises when no refuge is found. One becomes entirely despondent, thinking: 'Although I was born in the difficult-to-obtain Southern Continent Jambudvipa, achieved the rare precious human body with freedoms and advantages, met with the rare holy guru, and encountered the rare holy Dharma, learning something about what to adopt and abandon—alas! I, with my bad karma and wretched fortune, have not accomplished virtue but have committed extensive negative actions.' The physical manifestations of this despair are vivid: scratching one's chest until marked by fingernails, face turning pale, eyes streaming with tears, breathing trembling, and head and limbs shaking.\n\n'If in such a place there is no refuge whatsoever' points to the hellish realms or the moment of death described in the Sutra Teaching to Kings: 'One goes to another realm, lies on one's final bed, with just a little life remaining, terrified by the messengers of the Lord of Death... At that time, there is no refuge, protector, abode, or ally other than the Dharma.'\n\n'Then at that time what shall I do?' is the desperate question arising from this realization. There would be no method or recourse whatsoever, and one would be tormented by intense suffering and complete exhaustion. \n\nThis contemplation leads to the understanding that one should take refuge in the Three Jewels from this very moment, not waiting until it's too late. The power of support has three parts: firstly, relying on the refuge of the Three Jewels immediately; secondly, relying on the Bodhisattvas who possess the power of aspirational prayers; and thirdly, having taken refuge, practicing according to their instructions.",
    "<2><47> Combined Commentary on 'From Today I Take Refuge'\n\n'Therefore, in the Victorious Ones, the protectors of beings...' - Here begins the verse on the power of support, specifically taking refuge in a pure support rather than merely using refuge as an object of confession. The Victorious Ones refers to the perfect Buddhas who, from the moment they first generated supreme bodhicitta, have devoted themselves entirely to protecting all sentient beings throughout space.\n\n'Who strive for the purpose of protecting beings...' - This line describes how the Buddhas diligently work with utmost effort for the welfare of all sentient beings. Unlike ordinary beings who only seek protection when in danger, the Buddhas constantly strive to protect all beings through their practice and teachings.\n\n'Of great strength, who dispel all fears...' - The Buddhas are described as possessing great power, specifically the ten powers: knowledge of what is possible and impossible, knowledge of karmic ripening, knowledge of faculties, knowledge of elements, knowledge of inclinations, knowledge of paths leading everywhere, knowledge of meditative states, knowledge of past lives, knowledge of divine sight, and knowledge of the extinction of defilements. The Buddha's strength is extraordinary - scriptures mention that between each joint of the Tathagata's hands and feet exists the strength of hundreds of powerful beings. Their strength manifests both through physical power and wisdom, as illustrated in the Stone-Throwing Sutra where Buddha moved an immovable boulder.\n\n'From this very day, I go for refuge.' - Unlike confused beings who engage in negativity throughout life and only seek refuge in terror when death approaches (which is too late to benefit from), the practitioner resolves to take refuge immediately - whether morning, noon, or evening - from this moment until reaching enlightenment. This demonstrates the urgency of taking refuge now, not waiting until we experience rebirth in lower realms where finding refuge becomes impossible.",

This profound and vast Dharma, when practiced with full conviction, dispels or pacifies all the fears of saṃsāra without exception.\n\nSimilarly, I also take refuge authentically—without deceit or doubt—in the assembly of Bodhisattvas, the noble irreversible Saṅgha. These noble beings who have attained the irreversible state serve as companions on the path of practice.

His compassionate intention and conduct are unerring (spyod pa ma 'khrul ba), acting without contradiction. This unerring quality manifests through two aspects: spontaneous accomplishment and uninterrupted continuity as he works for the benefit of others, without even the slightest self-interest.\n\n'སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས་མགོན་དེ་ལ་ཡང་།' (To that protector Avalokiteśvara)\nAt all times and in all circumstances, he gazes upon all sentient beings with unwavering eyes, thus his appropriate name is 'The One Who Gazes with Unwavering Eyes' or 'Avalokiteśvara, the Protector' (spyan ras gzigs mgon).

All negative actions arise from conceptual thoughts, which in turn arise from self-grasping—the notion of 'I' and 'mine,' of self and other. At all times, without being able to focus my mind even for a moment, I follow harmful thoughts of attachment and aversion, accumulating negative karma that will lead to endless wandering in saṃsāra.

Like treating an illness, one must quickly purify negative deeds before their consequences fully ripen, following the teachings of the supreme physician, the Buddha.",
    "<2><54> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse speaks to the importance of applying antidotes to negative mental states by drawing a comparison with physical illness:\n\n**'If even when struck by ordinary diseases such as disorders of wind, bile, phlegm, and their combinations, one fears them and must follow the physician's words'** - This opening comparison points out that when we suffer from common physical illnesses, we naturally fear their consequences and willingly follow medical advice, taking prescribed medicines and enduring uncomfortable treatments like bloodletting or cauterization.\n\n**'Therefore, what need is there to mention that it is appropriate to rely on the remedy as prescribed by the supreme physician, the Buddha'** - This rhetorical question emphasizes how much more important it is to follow spiritual remedies, since mental afflictions are far more dangerous than physical ones.\n\n**'Since we have been continuously afflicted since beginningless time by the great chronic disease of the three poisons—attachment, hatred, ignorance, and other afflictions—which is the source of hundreds and thousands of faults'** - Unlike temporary physical illnesses, these mental afflictions have plagued us from beginningless time and are the root cause of our continued suffering in samsara.\n\n**'One should certainly strive for the antidote to negative actions'** by cultivating mindfulness, awareness, and patience, repeatedly meditating on karma and impermanence, and performing virtuous actions with the intention of confession during preparation, mindfulness during practice, and dedication for purification afterward.\n\n**'Even if one spends an entire lifetime practicing virtue in seclusion, if even minor faults are not confessed through antidotes, one will experience their karmic ripening'** - This emphasizes that virtuous actions alone, without specific application as antidotes to negativities, cannot prevent the ripening of negative karma, just as barley plants cannot prevent a pea plant from growing among them.\n\n**'These diseases represent great faults and their remedies are difficult to find'** - Unlike physical remedies that are readily available, the remedies for mental afflictions require diligent practice and sincere application of the Buddha's teachings to truly transform one's mindstream.",

For example, a single instance of anger toward a bodhisattva can cast beings into hell, thus causing great harm to all people dwelling in this world. And when the medicine that would heal these afflictive illnesses cannot be found from any direction whatsoever, no matter how much one searches—not even in Brahma's realm or elsewhere. Indeed, there is no medicine other than the holy Dharma and practicing in accordance with the Buddha's teachings, including the antidote of path meditation and other methods, that can cure these destructive mental states. This remedy is extremely rare and precious, for it alone has the power to heal the afflictions that torment all beings.",
    "<2><56> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nIn the context of spiritual healing, this verse refers to the Buddha as the ultimate physician. The Omniscient One, Buddha Bhagavan, is described as the supreme healer who completely extracts all the thorns of suffering affecting both body and mind. These thorns represent the afflictions that cause our spiritual illness.\n\nThose who think perversely and do not follow the Buddha's instructions are characterized as extremely foolish and deluded individuals. When one refuses to utilize the medicine of the sacred Dharma as taught in the scriptures, one becomes an object of scorn not only by the Buddha and his spiritual sons but even protective deities abandon and disparage such individuals.\n\nThis is illustrated by the story of the physician king Jīvaka Kumāra, who became proud, thinking, 'In this world, the Buddha Bhagavan is the physician who heals mental illness, while I am the physician who heals physical illness.' The Tathāgata took him to Mount Himalaya and asked him to gather medicinal herbs. Since Jīvaka could identify only a few while the Buddha knew them all perfectly, his pride was broken. This demonstrates that the Buddha alone, being omniscient, is the true physician, and the sacred Dharma is the only genuine medicine.\n\nTherefore, setting one's mind on following the causes of endless samsara and lower realms instead of the Buddha's teachings represents extreme delusion and a basis for reproach. As Nāgārjuna eloquently stated: 'One who uses a golden vessel adorned with jewels to collect vomit is not as foolish as one who, having been born as a human, commits sinful deeds.'\n\nHaving sincerely taken refuge in the Teacher, one should properly put the Teacher's doctrine into practice rather than contemplating not following his teachings, which would be a state of extreme ignorance deserving of reproach.",
    "<2><57> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse explains why one must be vigilant regarding the precipice of lower rebirths. It states: 'If one must dwell with mindfulness even at ordinary small precipices, then what need is there to mention the necessity regarding the precipice where one falls a thousand yojanas for a long time?'\n\nThe commentaries explain that if we must remain vigilant even near ordinary small precipices—such as the foot of stairs, mountains, or places where only a limb might be harmed by falling—then how much more vigilant should we be regarding the precipice of lower rebirths, symbolized as an abyss extending thousands of yojanas (twenty or thirty-two thousand leagues) deep?\n\nThis metaphorical precipice represents falling into the hell realms, such as Reviving Hell, where one experiences intense suffering for extremely long durations measured in intermediate kalpas. Once fallen into such depths, one cannot escape for a very long time.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that we should strive to apply antidotes to afflictive emotions and negative actions without delay. It refutes the thought that 'Although this negative action is seriously wrong, I can confess it later,' highlighting the unreliability of life and the urgency of spiritual practice.",
    "<2><58> Combined Commentary\n\nExplaining this verse sentence by sentence:\n\n**'Thinking 'I will not die just today''**: Although one needs to strive with antidotes to negative emotions, if one thinks 'I will exert effort next month or next year' rather than today, this is a mistake. When we assume 'I certainly will not die today,' we engage in self-deception that prevents urgent practice.\n\n**'It is not appropriate to dwell in comfort'**: Remaining at ease and settling comfortably without applying antidotes is unreasonable and inappropriate. It is a form of laziness that undermines spiritual progress. We should not postpone our spiritual efforts.\n\n**'The time when I will cease to exist'**: The time of my death, when I will die and no longer exist in this form, is inevitable. Moreover, there is no certainty that death won't happen even as soon as tonight or tomorrow.\n\n**'Will certainly arrive'**: This time will definitely and undoubtedly occur. As stated in Kaniṣka's Epistle: 'Moreover, saying 'Today I will do this' is not good for people. The morrow when you will no longer exist will certainly come.' And as the Letter to a Friend says: 'Life, afflicted by many harms, is more impermanent than a water bubble struck by wind.' Therefore, without laziness, one should exert effort from this very day.",
    "<2><59> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Who has given me fearlessness?' - This line questions who has granted the assurance that one need not fear death. The commentaries agree that no one, not even the Buddha, has given such a guarantee that we will not die or that we should not fear death. We all witness others dying and falling into lower realms, yet no authority has exempted us from this universal fate.\n\n'How shall I certainly be liberated from this?' - This asks how one could possibly escape from death with certainty. All commentaries emphasize that without diligent practice and application of antidotes to negative actions, liberation from death is impossible. As Commentary 1 quotes from the Sutra of Auspicious Night: 'Who knows whether one will die tomorrow? One should make effort today itself.'\n\n'If I will certainly cease to exist' - This line acknowledges the inevitability of death. All commentaries stress that death is certain and unavoidable, as Commentary 1 quotes from the Śokāpanodana: 'Have you seen, heard, or even doubted that anyone born on earth or in the heavens has not died?'\n\n'How is my mind at ease?' - This final line questions the irrationality of remaining comfortable and complacent despite knowing death is certain. The commentaries agree that it is inappropriate for the mind to remain relaxed, indulging in sensory pleasures and laziness, rather than diligently cultivating the path to liberation. One should abandon attachment to sense pleasures and possessions, recognizing their unreliability in the face of impermanence.",
    "<2><60> Combined Commentary\n\n'Previously experienced and destroyed' refers to all the worldly pleasures I have indulged in throughout saṃsāra, including the five objects of desire that I've experienced without exception. Yet after experiencing just a momentary pleasure from the contact between sense objects and consciousness, it is destroyed and nothing remains. Since it's impossible for pleasure to remain into a second moment, all such enjoyments have proven unreliable and perishable, lacking any real essence.\n\n'What remains for me' questions what special or meaningful pleasure could possibly remain that differs from before and doesn't disintegrate in the second moment. The answer is nothing whatsoever. No indestructible enjoyment exists among these worldly experiences.\n\n'I have become strongly attached' expresses how, despite knowing the essencelessness of these pleasures, I have become extremely fixated on these objects of desire, particularly things like meat, alcohol, women, and purposeless indulgences.\n\n'Transgressed the instructions of my spiritual teachers' shows how, for the sake of these fleeting pleasures, I've been unafraid to commit negativities, violating the instructions of my guru—my root teacher—and the Buddha Bhagavan along with his spiritual heirs. This transgression has brought ruin to both this and future lives.\n\nThe overall message instructs us to sever attachment to all objects of desire after recognizing their essencelessness. Just as children cannot stop playing with toys once started, we cannot stop indulging in sense pleasures without decisive abandonment. Since craving and grasping are the parents of existence, the greater one's craving, the greater one's negativity. Therefore, we must practice prioritizing what is important while discarding what is trivial.",

This is asking how one can be freed from the causes of sin and non-virtue that lead to these painful results.\n\n'Day and night, continuously, I should contemplate this alone.' This means that without sleeping, I should constantly contemplate this matter—specifically, the law of cause and effect regarding virtuous and non-virtuous actions—exclusively and nothing else.\n\n'It is appropriate that I alone contemplate this very question.' This indicates that such contemplation is reasonable and proper for anyone seeking liberation.\n\nIf one does not find deep, genuine certainty about karmic cause and effect, one will not find certainty in any aspect of Dharma that pleases the Victorious Ones. Therefore, everyone should strive in this regard. Some claim to have found certainty in emptiness and consequently disregard karmic cause and effect, but this clearly indicates their understanding has been inverted.\n\nFurthermore, just as washing is more important than dyeing a garment, the qualities of learning, contemplation, and meditation cannot arise in one's mindstream while it remains influenced by sins and non-virtues. This is why striving to purify negativities is taught to be extremely precious, and why one should generate the sincere wish to confess all negativities through various methods.",

The phrase 'again and again' is an elegant expression that conveys the necessity of great remorse and repeated acknowledgment of our faults.\n\n'I confess all those misdeeds' means openly acknowledging all faults and downfalls without concealing or hiding anything. This represents the fourth power in the confession process: the power of turning away from faults.",

This represents a confession where, like someone being questioned about their faults by the objects of confession, one openly admits one's mistakes and makes a sincere request for recognition of these faults.\n\n'འདི་ནི་བཟང་པོ་མ་ལགས་པས། །' (This is not good.)\nSince these evil actions I have committed are not good deeds but rather unwholesome and negative conduct that leads from light to darkness, producing unbearable ripening effects, and are condemned by noble beings, I recognize their harmful nature. This acknowledgment is part of the confession process.\n\n'སླན་ཆད་བདག་ནི་ཡོང་མི་བགྱིད། །' (Henceforth, I shall never do this again.)\nTherefore, from this day forward, I will never again engage in such negative actions, even at the cost of my life. This is my solemn pledge. This represents the power of restoration, where I interrupt the continuity of negative actions and maintain restraint in the future.\n\nThe confession presented here includes the complete antidote of the four powers. When practiced properly, even negative karma that would definitely be experienced can be purified through this method. There are two types of individuals who raise the victory banner of Dharma: those who do not commit faults and those who purify their faults through confession. Since we are not skilled in distinguishing the intricacies of karma and its effects, and since many doorways to negative actions arise each day, we should continually engage in confession with the four powers, especially to purify obstacles to generating the awakening mind.\n\nUpon completing this confession, imagine various light rays emanating from the bodies of the objects of confession, purifying all transgressions, downfalls, negativities, and obscurations of oneself and all sentient beings, just as the sun rising instantly dispels darkness in a dark room.",
    "<2><66> Combined Commentary Explanation of 'Confession of Negativities' (Chapter Two)\n\nFrom the 'Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life' (Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra), this concludes the second chapter entitled 'Confession of Negativities.'\n\nIn this chapter, I beseech the guides, the Victorious Ones together with their Bodhisattva offspring, to acknowledge that I am at fault and wrongful due to the negative actions I have committed. This confession involves personally admitting one's faults, just as if being questioned by the objects of confession.\n\nThe complete antidote to negativities presented here is confession endowed with the four powers. The fourth power, the power of restoration, is particularly emphasized: These negative, non-virtuous, and evil actions lead from light into darkness and produce utterly unbearable results. They are condemned by noble beings and are not good conduct. Therefore, from this day forward, even at the cost of my life, I shall never commit them again and will exercise restraint.\n\nWhen reciting this confession, one should imagine that various light rays emanate from the bodies of the Victorious Ones and their offspring, completely purifying all the transgressions, negativities, and obscurations of oneself and all sentient beings, like the sun rising in a dark cave.\n\nAs stated in scriptures like the Tarkajvala and the Great Commentary on the Eight Thousand Verses of the Perfection of Wisdom, even negativities that would definitely ripen can be purified through this approach. For those of us who lack expertise in distinguishing karmic cause and effect, or who fail to properly accept and reject accordingly despite some understanding, various doors to negativity arise each day.\n\nThere are two types of individuals who raise the victory banner of Dharma and lower the victory banner of Māra: those who do not commit transgressions, and those who purify them through confession when they occur. The virtue of negativities is that they can be cleansed through confession. As stated in the Letter to a Friend: 'One who was previously heedless but later becomes mindful is beautiful like the moon free from clouds, like Nanda, who wore a garland and found happiness in the presence of the Buddha.'\n\nWe should continuously engage in the path of confession with the four powers, and especially strive to purify obstacles to generating bodhichitta, since those afflicted by attachment, jealousy, and arrogance cannot generate the supreme mind of bodhichitta. Thus, all errors committed through body, speech, and mind, we sincerely confess to the Protector."

For those beings who experience the torments of hell and other lower realms, I rejoice in the causes—their virtuous deeds performed with motivations of renunciation, practices of the ten virtues, and so forth (though not enhanced by the realization of selflessness)—that temporarily free them from such suffering and allow them to obtain higher rebirth. Regarding the results of these virtues, I sincerely rejoice without jealousy or competitive thoughts when those who possess suffering are able to dwell in the relative happiness of higher realms as gods and humans, enjoying the fruits of their previous positive actions in the form of excellent appearance, youth, power, fame, wealth, and possessions.

As it is stated, 'The wisdom that knows exhaustion and non-arising is called enlightenment,' and these virtues are the goodness conducive to liberation.\n\n'I rejoice in the definite liberation of embodied beings from the sufferings of saṃsāra.'\n\nRegarding the effect, I rejoice with faith in the definite liberation of embodied beings from the sufferings of the three realms of saṃsāra, such as birth, aging, sickness, and death. These beings have attained the states of learners (stream-enterers, once-returners, and non-returners) and non-learners (Arhats). Their ocean of blood and tears has dried up, and their mountain of bones has been demolished. I rejoice when sentient beings attain nirvāṇa, recalling the qualities of their abandonment and realization where gold and stones are viewed equally, and remembering the kindness of the compassionate Teacher who established the holy Dharma of Vinaya as both teaching and teacher, through which we have encountered the Dharma.",

This means that without any time limit, until their illness is completely cured, the bodhisattva makes the following commitments.\n\n'May I become medicine' refers to the aspiration to become excellent remedies that pacify disease—similar to how the Buddha in a previous life as King Padma Nyarohita healed sickness, or like beneficial creatures such as the desman.

    "<3><9> Combined Commentary Explanation:\n\n'སེམས་ཅན་ཕོངས་ཤིང་དབུལ་བ་ལ། །' (For sentient beings who are destitute and impoverished)\nFor living beings in the world who are destitute and impoverished due to lack of food, drink, clothing, wealth, and possessions, this verse begins the fifth section of the text which focuses on mind training for benefiting others. This practice is crucial as a cause for generating bodhicitta in one's mindstream, since altruistic intention cannot arise without severing attachment to self-interest.\n\n'བདག་ནི་མི་ཟད་གཏེར་གྱུར་ཏེ། །' (May I become an inexhaustible treasure)\nMay I become like an inexhaustible treasury that sentient beings can freely utilize, transforming myself into a source of limitless benefit. This represents the actual practice of mind training, which involves giving away the three bases of self-grasping (body, possessions, and roots of virtue). For beginners, this giving is done mentally rather than physically, as becoming accustomed to a generous mindset is the essence of perfecting the paramita of generosity.\n\n'ཡོ་བྱད་མཁོ་དགུ་སྣ་ཚོགས་སུ། །' (As various necessities and requisites of all kinds)\nMay I manifest as various necessary implements and supplies according to the wishes of sentient beings—food for those who crave food, drink for those who crave drink, clothing for those who need clothing, and all other necessities.

This aspirational practice cultivates the intention to give away one's body, possessions, and roots of virtue for the benefit of others. Even if one lacks the power to perform actual altruistic actions, maintaining this intention is engaging in the purpose through the power of that intention.",
    "<3><10> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'The body, likewise enjoyments, and all virtues of the three times, for the sake of accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings, should be given away without miserliness.'\n\nThis verse instructs us to give away three objects that we typically cherish as our own: our physical body, all our enjoyments such as wealth, food, and clothing, and all roots of virtue accumulated throughout the past, present, and future times. These three bases should be completely relinquished for the purpose of accomplishing both the temporary and ultimate welfare and happiness of all sentient beings without exception.\n\nWe should give these away with complete sincerity, without any trace of miserliness or attachment, expecting nothing in return—no gratitude, reciprocity, or even karmic results. This practice should involve both verbal recitation of these verses and clear, repeated contemplation in our minds.\n\nThis instruction addresses the very foundation of cyclic existence—self-grasping—by applying the medicine of emptiness and non-referential compassion. Whenever thoughts of attachment to the body or possessions arise, we should directly confront and oppose them. When facing dangers in isolated places, we should think: 'I have already given these three bases to others, so there is nothing left to cherish as mine.' This thought alone lightens the mind's burden, bringing ease to consciousness.\n\nIf self-grasping returns, we can verbally recite these verses while visualizing our body and possessions being consumed by others. This practice constitutes both mind training and true generosity, embodying the essence of Chöd practice: cutting the root of self-grasping.\n\nThe Śikṣāsamuccaya teaches that we should not only give these three bases to all beings but also protect them from adverse conditions, purify them of defilements, and increase them through progressively higher methods. Furthermore, even when using our own food and clothing after having given them away, we should consume them with the attitude of a servant using the master's property for the master's purpose. Otherwise, it becomes taking what is not given.\n\nThrough this practice of unconditional giving, we abandon attachment to all things, cultivate the path toward nirvana, and recognize sentient beings as the supreme field of generosity to whom it is appropriate to give everything.",
    "<3><11> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'By renouncing everything, one attains nirvana.' This verse teaches that liberation (nirvana) is achieved through complete renunciation. The path to freedom requires letting go of all attachments and possessions.\n\n'And my mind seeks to accomplish nirvana.' Here, the author expresses their personal aspiration to achieve liberation. As one who follows the Buddha's teachings and has entered the monastic life, they naturally seek the state beyond suffering.\n\n'If I must give up everything at once,' acknowledges the inevitability of renunciation. This line recognizes that whether through practice now or at death, all possessions and even one's body must eventually be relinquished. All conditioned virtues must ultimately be transcended to attain complete enlightenment.\n\n'Then it is best to give to sentient beings.' This final line reveals the Mahayana approach to renunciation. Instead of simply abandoning things, the supreme method is to give them to others with compassionate intent. This transforms the act of renunciation into generosity, creating merit that leads to unabiding nirvana (Buddhahood) while benefiting others.\n\nBy giving to sentient beings now, while one still has autonomy, nothing is wasted. This approach brings great benefit for both self and others, as it serves as a cause for achieving the supreme fruition of complete enlightenment. Even when giving to those who inflict harm upon oneself, such generosity without expectation becomes a powerful cause of benefit for all beings.",

Since I have already given this body of mine to all sentient beings without reservation, what is the point of concerning myself with protecting it from harm or seeking advantages for it? Having completely relinquished ownership of my body, they may do as they please with it. This verse effectively refutes the notion of having control over one's body, teaching us to abandon self-cherishing attachment to our physical form.",
    "<3><14> Combined Commentary:\n\n'Let them engage in whatever actions—positive or negative—that do not cause harm or negativity to them, either temporarily or in the long term.' This refers to allowing beings to perform actions that will bring benefit to themselves and others, now and in the future—that is, virtuous actions that will not cause harm. This instruction should be applied to appropriate actions.\n\n'By focusing on me, may not even a single sentient being at any time ever become meaningless.' This states the general principle that the bodhisattva aspires to be solely a cause of benefit to others. It means, 'May I never become a cause for any being, at any time, to experience meaningless harm, having taken me as their object of focus.' The practitioner is praying that no sentient being will ever be without purpose, benefit, or happiness when they interact with them.\n\nThis verse contains the dedication that makes one's intention meaningful, praying for the cause whereby performed actions directed toward the practitioner do not go to waste, ensuring that interactions with the bodhisattva always lead to something beneficial.",
    "<3><15> Combined Commentary:\n\nWhen another person focuses on me and either develops an angry mind wishing to harm me, or faith arises in their mind with devotion toward me, may that very mental state—whether anger or devotion—always become the cause for accomplishing all their desired aims. This means that whether sentient beings give rise to thoughts of anger or faith toward me, may those very states of mind serve as causes for them to achieve both their temporary goals (such as material things) and ultimate spiritual aims at all times. This verse teaches that such intentions directed toward the practitioner are never wasted but instead become meaningful causes for others' benefit. As the Great Commentary notes regarding 'mind of faith' (dad pa'i sems), it can also be understood in contrast to 'lack of faith' (ma dad). This constitutes a profound dedication that transforms all interactions with others into opportunities for their benefit, thus making one's spiritual practice truly meaningful.",

This prayer demonstrates that one's spiritual practice is not wasted even when faced with difficult circumstances.\n\nThis verse is part of a broader section that includes praying to be the cause of others' necessities, praying for extensive time and activity, and praying without interruption of place and time. As stated in the Sutra of the Meeting of Father and Son: 'May those who offer me food attain the happiness of perfect peace.' This represents a dedication as a cause of benefit for all beings, aspiring that all sentient beings connected to us—whether through seeing, hearing, thinking of, or touching—may accomplish all their desired aims and achieve all temporary and ultimate benefits without exception.",

    "<3><20> Combined Commentary\n\nJust as the great elements (mahābhūta)—earth, water, fire, wind, and space—sustain all living beings, this verse expresses the aspiration to benefit others in similar ways. The four elements are called 'great' because of their vast support and extensive pervasiveness. Each element serves a specific function: earth provides support, water provides cohesion, fire ripens things, wind prevents decay and provides movement, while space pervades everything and creates openings. As taught in the Ratnakūṭa Sūtra, bodhisattvas benefit sentient beings in ways similar to these five elements. Thus, the verse expresses the profound aspiration: 'May I too, like these elements and especially like space which is constant, become the basis for the diverse means of sustenance for immeasurable sentient beings.' This includes providing support, gathering beings together, ripening their minds, facilitating movement, creating space, as well as supplying necessities such as food, clothing, wealth, and enjoyments. This constitutes a far-reaching and extensive aspiration to benefit all beings in countless ways.",
    "<3><21> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Thus' or 'In this way' refers to how the realm of sentient beings pervades as far as the limits of space, without cessation or end. The phrase 'sentient beings, reaching to the limits of space' indicates the vast scope of the aspiration, encompassing all beings throughout the entirety of space.\n\n'In all ways and at all times' (or 'in infinite ways') means that until all those sentient beings have 'reached beyond sorrow' or 'attained nirvana'—that is, until all have become buddhas with none remaining—the practitioner makes their commitment.\n\n'May I be a source of sustenance' or 'may I serve as a cause of their sustenance' expresses the wish to provide whatever various enjoyments sentient beings might need, benefiting them in all possible ways.\n\nThis aspiration represents a training for long-lasting continuity of commitment. This mind training serves both as a preliminary practice before generating bodhicitta and as a subsequent training, requiring practitioners to expand their minds through such vast aspirations.\n\nGyelha and Dralé Namgyal consider these verses to be the generation of aspirational bodhicitta. The current extent of buddhas' and bodhisattvas' enlightened activities appears proportionate to the breadth of their aspirations and bodhicitta, which makes this practice extremely important.\n\nFor the main practice that follows, if receiving teachings from a teacher, one should first say, 'O teacher,' or if receiving from a representation, one should say, 'May all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions please pay attention to me,' especially if one wishes to take the aspirational and engaged vows separately.",

This includes the training in the ethical discipline of vows and other precepts that constitute the bodhisattva path.\n\n'དེ་དག་རིམ་བཞིན་གནས་པ་ལྟར། །' - Just as they abided in them in sequence: This indicates how the previous Buddhas proceeded step by step from the beginner's stage to the Buddha level, training in proper sequence - not practicing advanced practices like giving away one's body prematurely with impure motivation, but rather practicing at the appropriate time when there is no fault and when one can accumulate great merit.\n\nWhen reciting these verses, one is essentially declaring that just as the previous enlightened beings generated bodhicitta and trained in the bodhisattva path, so too will the practitioner follow in their footsteps. This can be recited three times during the ritual of taking the bodhisattva vow, either in the presence of a qualified preceptor or before the mentally visualized assembly of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.",
    "<3><23> Combined Commentary\n\nJust as the previous Tathāgatas generated bodhicitta, I too, for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings equal to space, will generate the aspiration mind of bodhicitta for the purpose of attaining the unsurpassed state of Buddhahood. \n\nSimilarly, I will also take the engaged bodhicitta vows and train in the bodhisattva disciplines such as the six perfections, progressively according to my ability from this time onward. \n\nThe point of receiving the vow occurs when this commitment to enter the bodhisattva path is recited three times, specifically at the end of the third recitation. At that moment, one should generate the understanding that 'I have now received the vows of aspiration and engagement in my mindstream.'\n\nAccording to Master Sāgaramegha, 'The first recitation establishes aspiration, the second establishes engagement, and the third makes them firm,' so one must generate this understanding of receiving the vow.\n\n'Training in the proper sequence' means not attempting practices beyond one's capacity, such as giving away one's body prematurely with impure motivation. As the Śikṣāsamuccaya states, 'One should take up the trainings in accordance with one's own strength.' The Sūtra Requested by Subāhu clarifies this by stating, 'From time to time, little by little...' teaching that one cannot train in the ocean-like conduct of bodhisattvas all at once, but rather progressively.\n\nSome traditions explain that one trains sequentially in the three types of ethical discipline at different stages of the path: on the path of accumulation one trains in the ethical discipline of restraining from misconduct, on the path of preparation one trains in the ethical discipline of gathering virtuous qualities, and on the noble path one trains in the ethical discipline of benefiting sentient beings.\n\nThe conclusion of this practice involves cultivating joy in oneself for having obtained this rare mind of bodhicitta, and encouraging others to likewise generate joy.",
    "<3><24> Combined Commentary:\n\nAs thus explained, a wise and intelligent bodhisattva, having firmly grasped and generated bodhicitta (the awakening mind) with sincere and clear faith through the preparatory and main rituals, should then—in order to further stabilize and expand it afterward so that the vow does not degenerate but rather increases and develops more and more—encourage, uplift, and delight their mind in the following manner. This uplifting of the mind serves to implement the extensive concluding methods that prevent the deterioration and promote the increase of bodhicitta. This section consists of two parts: generating joy in oneself and generating joy in others, with the first subsection being the generation of joy through accomplishing one's own purpose.",
    "<3><25> Combined Commentary:\n\nAt the time of generating bodhicitta and taking the vows, my present life has become meaningful or fruitful, as indicated by 'Today my life has great fruit.'

This signifies my transformation into a bodhisattva, one who will continue their lineage.\n\nAnd finally, I 'have now become a child of the Buddha' or 'the heart-son of all Buddhas.' This realization—thinking 'When will I become a son of the Buddhas?' and then recognizing 'Now I have become a son of the Buddhas'—is the cultivation of joy in the bodhisattva path.",

    "<3><27> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as a blind person finding a precious wish-fulfilling jewel among piles of swept dust would be considered extremely wondrous and would generate great joy, similarly, 'somehow by chance' - this precious bodhicitta has arisen in me. This comparison illustrates the extreme rarity and difficulty of obtaining bodhicitta. The word 'somehow' (ji zhig ltar) indicates that it happens by the power of coincidence, just as 'letters eaten by worms are by chance, not through accomplishment.' It is truly remarkable that this precious bodhicitta, which dispels all the miseries of existence and peace, has arisen within me from amidst the dust of afflictions in the ordinary state of being. This is certainly due to the Buddha's blessing and should be viewed as extremely wondrous, generating great joy and delight. This section begins the explanation of bodhicitta's ability to remove the suffering of sentient beings, which includes conquering the lord of death, poverty, illness, the general suffering of existence, and specifically the suffering of lower realms.",

Bodhisattvas teach the Dharma to sentient beings in accordance with their individual inclinations, thereby completely destroying the demon of death for limitless beings without exception. This bodhicitta establishes beings on the ground of agelessness and deathlessness, making it superior to the accomplishment nectar of divine, nāga, and human knowledge-holders that can merely prevent death for many centuries. As stated in the Uttaratantra: 'Having attained the abode of deathless peace, the demon of death has no opportunity to roam.'\n\n'འགྲོ་བའི་དབུལ་བ་སེལ་བ་ཡི། །མི་ཟད་གཏེར་ཡང་འདི་ཡིན་ནོ། །' - This bodhicitta is also the great inexhaustible treasure that completely dispels or eliminates all poverty of beings. At the eighth bhūmi, having gained mastery over provisions, bodhicitta itself becomes the sky-treasury of enjoyments that bestows inexhaustible resources, both material and Dharmic. It is the ultimate remedy that addresses both spiritual poverty through the gift of Dharma and material poverty through generosity.",
    "<3><29> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis bodhicitta is the supreme medicine that pacifies all the diseases of sentient beings. It addresses both the causal diseases of afflictions such as attachment, aversion, and ignorance, and their resultant diseases of suffering related to wind, bile, phlegm, and so forth. Bodhisattvas teach the Dharma of unattractiveness, loving-kindness, dependent origination, and selflessness, thereby completely pacifying all causal and resultant diseases affecting both body and mind of sentient beings.\n\nBodhicitta also serves as a refreshing shade tree that provides cool respite for those who wander and grow weary on the path of existence. Sentient beings who have wandered for a long time in saṃsāra's cycle become exhausted by suffering. Bodhisattvas, having mastered the paths of the three vehicles, teach the appropriate path to beings according to their capacity, including the Hearers' path to those of middling capacity who possess the Hearer and Solitary Realizer lineages. Since this pacifies the suffering of existence, bodhicitta provides a place of true rest that relieves the fatigue of suffering for all beings. Even the attainment of the Hearer and Solitary Realizer fruits arises from the power of this very bodhicitta.",

It is like a universal stairway that establishes beings in the happiness of higher rebirth as gods and humans. The term 'common platform' (སྤྱི་སྟེགས) functions like a footstool or foundation that supports all paths, as beings must first be established in higher rebirth before they can be guided to the definite goodness of the three vehicles. This bodhicitta becomes the fundamental causeway that all practitioners must cross to escape lower realms.\n\n**འགྲོ་བའི་ཉོན་མོངས་གདུང་སེལ་བའི། །སེམས་ཀྱི་ཟླ་བ་ཤར་བ་ཡིན། །**\n(It is the risen moon of the mind that dispels the torment of beings' afflictions.)\n\nAfter establishing beings in higher rebirth, this supreme bodhicitta functions as the risen moon of the mind that cools and dispels the burning heat of beings' afflictive obscurations. Just as the moon naturally cools the heat of day, bodhicitta has the power to overcome all obscurations of afflictions—attachments and other mental afflictions that obstruct liberation. As Protector Maitreya states, these afflictive obscurations include 'conceptualizations of miserliness and so forth'—referring to all gross factors opposed to the six perfections. This moon-like bodhicitta has specifically risen to remove the torment and suffering caused by these obscurations.",

Just as a powerful sun instantly dispels darkness throughout the three thousand-fold universe, bodhicitta completely eliminates all cognitive obscurations, which are the ignorance preventing one from understanding the true nature of phenomena. These obscurations arise when one clings to the three spheres (subject, object, and action) as truly existent, which limits one's perception to single objects rather than simultaneously perceiving all objects of knowledge.\n\n'དམ་ཆོས་འོ་མ་བསྲུབས་པ་ལས། །མར་གྱི་ཉིང་ཁུ་བྱུང་བ་ཡིན། །'\n(It is the butter essence that has emerged from churning the milk of the sublime Dharma.)\n\nThis bodhicitta is the quintessential butter essence extracted from thoroughly churning the great ocean of milk—the Buddha's sacred Dharma teachings of the three wheels—with the churning rod of wisdom derived from hearing and contemplation. It represents the purest of the pure, the supreme essence that has been extracted from all the sublime Dharma teachings. This butter essence is endowed with the taste and potency that generates all benefits and happiness, which is why everyone should strive to cultivate it. It is the wisdom realizing emptiness, adorned with vast accumulations, that exhausts the seeds of cognitive obscurations.",

For those who, having suffered, desire to experience the pleasant enjoyments and temporary happiness of gods and humans, this generation of bodhicitta serves as the supreme method for accomplishing happiness. This bodhisattva, through the power of bodhicitta, remains present in saṃsāra to bring about the supreme happiness of immortal peace and other benefits as previously explained. Just as dye clings to fabric, this bodhicitta truly abides as the supreme bliss, not abandoning sentient beings who, without finding a permanent dwelling place, move ever closer to death. It satisfies the great multitude of guest beings, fulfilling them with whatever happiness they desire, and accomplishing both higher rebirth and definitive excellence for all sentient beings.",

By encouraging them to cultivate joy, they obtain a share of the benefits through their rejoicing and are inspired to provide protection. Additionally, establishing them as witnesses serves as a basis for the practitioner's sense of shame and conscience in maintaining this commitment.\n\nThis passage comes from the third chapter entitled 'Thoroughly Embracing the Awakening Mind as Primary' (or 'Thoroughly Adopting Bodhicitta') from 'Entering the Bodhisattva's Way of Life.'",
    "<3><34> Combined Commentary Explanation of the Third Chapter Colophon\n\nIn this concluding verse of the third chapter, we have the formal title of the chapter. From 'Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Conduct' (Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra), this is the third chapter called 'Thoroughly Adopting the Bodhicitta' (Bodhicittaparigraha).\n\nThis chapter has explained how one invites all sentient beings as guests before all the protectors—the Victorious Buddhas and their Bodhisattva heirs—as witnesses. The practitioner, from this day forward, commits to providing all beings with both the ultimate happiness (the state of Buddhahood itself) and, until that is attained, the temporary happiness of higher rebirth with the excellent pleasures of gods and humans.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes that before generating the two types of bodhicitta (aspiring and engaging), one should first purify adverse conditions (obscurations) and accumulate favorable conditions (merit and wisdom). All deities of the positive side, such as the seventy-five glorious protectors of the pure realms, as well as asuras and other beings, are encouraged to rejoice in this commitment, thereby receiving a share of the benefits and providing protection to the practitioner.\n\nBy establishing these enlightened beings as witnesses, the practitioner creates a foundation for a sense of shame and conscience that supports their bodhisattva vow. This entire process represents the supreme method for extracting the essence from this precious human existence with its freedoms and advantages—the single path traversed by millions of Bodhisattvas and the essential meaning of all the Buddha's teachings."

This designation is not merely for those with loving thoughts toward beings, but primarily for those motivated by a great resolve seeking perfect enlightenment for the dual purpose of benefiting self and others. The entire Mahāyāna path consists of two aspects: the intention (generating bodhicitta aimed at supreme enlightenment) and the application (practicing the six perfections).\n\n'བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་རབ་བརྟན་བཟུང་ནས། །' (Having firmly grasped the bodhicitta)\n\n'Firmly grasping' bodhicitta means that when generating this mind of enlightenment, one must hold it with unwavering determination: 'From this moment on, I will never abandon bodhicitta no matter what happens.' This involves the complete three aspects of preparation, main practice, and conclusion. Setting this intention is crucial—similar to how one can achieve lucid dreaming by firmly setting the intention beforehand. The essence of this verse points to maintaining bodhicitta rather than merely generating it.\n\n'གཡེལ་བ་མེད་པར་རྟག་ཏུ་ཡང་། །' (Without negligence, constantly)\n\nOne must practice without laziness or procrastination, maintaining constant vigilance and diligence. As stated in the King of Samādhi Sūtra: 'Discipline, learning, generosity, patience, and so forth—whatever is described as virtuous qualities—all have conscientiousness as their root.' This vigilant attention means being ever-mindful of what should be adopted and abandoned, without being negligent even for a moment, at all times.\n\n'བསླབ་ལས་མི་འདའ་འབད་པར་བྱ། །' (Strive not to transgress the trainings)\n\nThe bodhisattva should strive diligently not to transgress or compromise the precepts, such as the eighteen root downfalls of the bodhisattva vows and other prohibitions. Since the bodhisattva trainings are as vast as an ocean, one must understand what constitutes the primary trainings: what to abandon (like the eighteen root downfalls) and what to adopt (the six perfections and activities benefiting sentient beings). The essence of conscientiousness is precisely this vigilant attention to what should be adopted and abandoned, as ethical discipline forms the foundation for all qualities of learning, contemplation, and meditation.",

Since there is no valid reason for hesitation, one should protect bodhicitta without deterioration until attaining Buddhahood.\n\nThis verse introduces the second section, which has three parts: (1) the dangers of going to lower realms, (2) failing in benefiting others, and (3) postponing the attainment of the grounds.

If, after having solemnly pledged to liberate all sentient beings from the sufferings of both cyclic existence and complacent peace, and to establish them in the state of complete Buddhahood as previously explained, I do not strive to actually accomplish this through practical application of my actions (through body, speech, and mind), then I will have gravely deceived all those sentient beings. I will have invited them as guests with the promise of Buddhahood but failed to deliver what I promised.\n\nWhat then will become of me, the deceiver? What sort of rebirth will I experience? The answer is clear and sobering: I will inevitably descend to the lower realms such as hell, as there would be no alternative destination for one who has broken such a profound commitment.

The Sūtra on Analyzing the Realms of Existence further elaborates that if someone resolves to give food items like rice, vegetables, roots, or fruits but withholds them due to miserliness, they will experience 'the world of hungry ghosts and unbearable suffering.'

    "<4><6> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n'After earnestly and wholeheartedly aspiring to the supreme bliss of Buddhahood—not merely with words but with deep sincerity—and having invited all sentient beings throughout space as guests to both unsurpassed happiness and temporary happiness, if one then deceives all beings by abandoning this commitment, how could one possibly journey to the higher realms? Indeed, one could not.\n\nOne might object: 'But what about the Venerable Śāriputra who, in a previous life as King Vinasiva, generated bodhicitta and served ten thousand Buddhas while engaging in the bodhisattva conduct? When a malevolent Māra appeared in the form of a brahmin asking for alms, Śāriputra cut off his right hand and offered it with his left. The brahmin said, 'I will not accept an offering given disrespectfully,' and threw it away. Discouraged by these words of dissatisfaction, Śāriputra abandoned his bodhicitta vow, yet later attained arhatship as is taught.'\n\nSimilarly, from the biographical accounts of Suvarṇavarṇa (Golden Color), it is mentioned that a bodhisattva who had practiced the conduct for forty eons abandoned bodhicitta and immediately became a pratyekabuddha. One might argue that these accounts contradict the position stated in the verse, but in fact there is no contradiction. These cases involve special circumstances with their own particular explanations, and do not negate the general principle that abandoning one's commitment to benefit beings after inviting them as guests is a grave deception that obstructs higher rebirth.'",

Devalha explains: 'Even if bodhicitta is abandoned temporarily through skillful means, by properly taking it up again, one liberates all sentient beings.'

This explains the reasoning behind the severity of this downfall: when bodhicitta is abandoned, the practitioner's ability to benefit all beings universally becomes compromised and diminished.\n\n'When such a downfall occurs, due to the deterioration of the altruistic intention, one becomes deficient in benefiting all sentient beings, as the foundation for practicing has been corrupted.' This clarifies that the abandonment of bodhicitta represents a fundamental corruption of the very basis of bodhisattva practice, which is the altruistic intention to benefit all beings.\n\nAs substantiated in the Noble Sampling Sutra (Ārya-saṃcaya): 'Even if one practices the ten virtuous actions for millions of aeons, if one generates a desire for the state of an Arhat or Pratyekabuddha, at that moment one's ethical discipline becomes flawed and degenerates. Such an abandonment of bodhicitta is far heavier than even a defeat (pārājika).'",

As stated in the Sutra of the Magical Display of Profound Peace and Definitive Certainty: 'Even compared to someone who steals the possessions of and kills all sentient beings in Jambudvipa, one who obstructs the virtue of a bodhisattva—even the mere giving of a single morsel of food to an animal—generates far more numerous sins.' We should be extremely careful about this matter since we do not know who might be a bodhisattva, and this negativity is very easy to incur. By obstructing a bodhisattva's activities, one commits a root downfall of the bodhisattva vows that turns one away from perfect enlightenment.",
    "<4><10> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse explains the severe consequences of harming others' happiness. If one destroys even the temporal happiness of a single sentient being, one will oneself deteriorate and fall from higher realms into lower ones, as stated in the sutras. This is because harming others damages one's own spiritual well-being. So, what need is there even to mention the consequences of destroying the happiness of countless embodied beings who pervade the entirety of limitless space? The sin is immeasurably greater. \n\nSpecifically, by creating obstacles to a bodhisattva's virtue, one destroys the causes of great happiness for innumerable sentient beings, thereby falling from fortunate rebirths and taking rebirth in the lower realms without end. As the Sutra of the Magical Display that Determines Perfect Peace states: 'If someone were to rob and kill all the sentient beings in Jambudvipa, the sin would be less than that committed by one who obstructs even the slightest virtuous act of a bodhisattva, such as giving a single morsel of food to an animal.' This is because if bodhisattvas are unobstructed in generating bodhicitta, they will achieve Buddhahood, emanate various light rays into the three lower realms, temporarily establish beings in happiness, and gradually lead all sentient beings to the great enlightenment and bliss of Buddhahood.",
    "<4><11> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Thus, if one alternates between powerful transgressions of abandoning bodhicitta and then generating powerful bodhicitta again' - This verse warns against the misconception that bodhisattva downfalls can be easily healed unlike pratimoksha vows. Even if one thinks they can simply confess and retake the bodhicitta vow, alternating between abandoning bodhicitta (a powerful downfall) and then generating it again creates serious consequences.\n\n'they will cycle in saṃsāra, having to be reborn alternately in lower and higher realms due to karma and afflictions' - This pattern of alternating between abandoning and taking bodhicitta causes one to cycle back and forth in samsara, experiencing the karmic consequences of these actions.\n\n'There will be a long delay in attaining the first and subsequent grounds (bhumis)' - While confession may purify the downfalls enough to avoid lower rebirth, these transgressions still obstruct the development of new spiritual qualities in one's mindstream. This significantly delays progress toward attaining even the temporary levels such as the first bhumi, let alone ultimate enlightenment.\n\nThis is illustrated by stories like that of Tilopa, who was destined to attain supreme siddhi in seven days but, because he secretly took a handful of sesame seeds, his attainment was delayed by seven months. Therefore, one should strive never to let the mind of awakening deteriorate, even at the cost of one's life.",

The Buddha cannot protect me if I willfully neglect my vows and commitments.",

This failure is not due to any shortcoming of the Buddhas, but entirely due to my own misdeeds, negative actions, and faults—specifically, having transgressed precepts, deteriorated my bodhicitta, and abandoned proper training. Just as a physician cannot help a patient whose illness is incurable, I have not been receptive to the Buddhas' beneficial guidance and leadership. This mirrors what is stated in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra: 'Even though the king of gods may send down rain...' suggesting that despite the Buddhas' constant presence and compassion, one's own negative karma can prevent receiving their blessings. This is similar to how Devadatta fell directly into hell in the presence of our Teacher, the master of the three worlds, who despite being free from all faults and possessing all qualities, could not rescue him.",

If one thinks, 'I will be protected later,' but continues to act just as before without mindfulness, one creates the causes for ongoing suffering.\n\nI would be born in the lower realms, and even if I escaped from there and took birth in a higher state, I would still experience suffering due to the residual effects of my actions: numerous diseases, being bound by iron chains and the like, being cut by swords and such, being chopped by axes and so forth.\n\nThe consequences of careless actions manifest as birth in lower realms, and even when obtaining higher rebirth, one experiences the remnants of negative karma through illness, bondage, dismemberment, and countless other sufferings. One does not become 'an object of healing' but instead faces a continuous stream of painful experiences.\n\nThis verse belongs to the section on being mindful by contemplating the support of leisure and endowments, which has three parts: contemplating how difficult it is to obtain leisure and endowments; contemplating how difficult it is to escape from the lower realms; and showing that when one has obtained leisure and endowments, one must strive in virtue. The verse also connects to the teaching that once the precious human rebirth endowed with freedoms and advantages is obtained, it quickly disintegrates, so one should strive diligently without delay.",

There, I will be constantly tormented by the sufferings of hell and so forth, and will become completely deluded and bewildered about what to adopt and what to abandon. At that time, what virtue will I be able to perform? What will I be able to do? I will have no opportunity or means to accomplish even the slightest virtuous action. Therefore, I should strive diligently now while I have obtained these freedoms and advantages, as failing to do so means I will not attain a higher rebirth in the future.",

This underscores why it is extremely difficult to obtain the precious human rebirth with its leisures and endowments (dal 'byor). The consequence of moral failure is not just temporary suffering but an almost inconceivable duration of separation from fortunate states of existence. Thus, this verse serves as a scriptural proof highlighting the urgency of practicing virtue and avoiding negative actions in this precious human life.",

    "<4><21> Combined Commentary Explanation:\n\n**When one gives rise to harmful thoughts towards a bodhisattva or commits a heinous crime such as one of the five immediate karmas, it is said that even by a sin committed in a single moment at the end of time or at the completion of an action, one will dwell in the Avīci hell for an entire eon and experience suffering.** According to the commentaries, this refers to the very moment in which a negative action is completed. If one were to generate a malicious thought toward a special object, even if it were just for the briefest moment, by that alone one would remain in the Avīci hell for an eon.\n\n**If that is so, then due to the negative, non-virtuous actions accumulated in saṃsāra from beginningless time until now, one will experience suffering in the lower realms for a prolonged period without liberation—needless to mention that one will not go to the higher realms; it need not be explained.** Due to sins accumulated since beginningless saṃsāra that remain in one's mindstream—without being overcome by their antidotes—one will not go to higher realms.\n\n**In general, even though the cause may be small, the result can be great.** For example, when taking life, even though the action takes only a short time, one must experience the suffering of hell for an entire intermediate eon as a result. So, how many sins accumulated from beginningless time have we not exhausted through experiencing their results or purified through confession?\n\n**Regarding how karmas ripen, the Abhidharma states: 'Of karmas, whichever is heavier, closer, more habitual, or done earlier—from among these, the former ones ripen first.'** Thus, when virtuous and non-virtuous actions ripen, at the time of death, whichever action is closest (to be experienced in the next life) will be experienced first. If there is none, then whichever is more habitual, or if there is none, then earlier ones will be experienced first.\n\n**Therefore, there is no certainty that a sinner will obtain a higher rebirth due to previous virtuous actions at the time of death, nor that a religious person will not be born in hell due to previous non-virtuous actions, because it is uncertain whether all previous negative actions have been purified and exhausted through confession and experience.** Therefore, one should strive to purify sin through the four powers.",
    "<4><22> Combined Commentary\n\nHaving merely experienced the suffering of hell and other lower realms that result from previous negative karma, a being will not be automatically liberated from those lower realms. If one thinks, 'After exhausting the results of sinful actions, one will be reborn in a higher realm, so liberation from lower realms is not difficult,' this is mistaken. \n\nThis is because while experiencing the suffering that results from previous karma, one continuously accumulates other sins such as malice, anger, and killing as concordant results. Since virtuous actions have little power in the lower realms, and one continuously generates new causes of suffering, the cycle perpetuates itself.\n\nThis is illustrated by stories such as those of the hawk, wolf, panther, and two swift travelers, which show how beings caught in negative states continue generating causes for further suffering.\n\nAccording to explanatory reasoning, this relates to the reasoning of natural order among the four valid reasonings. However, since beings in hell realms are experiencing ripening results, if they continuously accumulate new causes while experiencing previous effects, it raises questions about how liberation could ever occur.\n\nTherefore, one should strive to eliminate the causes of lower rebirth while one has the precious human rebirth with its freedoms and endowments, rather than deceiving oneself by failing to practice virtue.",

Having obtained this rare and meaningful human freedom that allows us to practice Dharma, and having met with authentic teachings and a qualified spiritual guide, if I fail to familiarize myself with virtue—whether aiming for the supreme goal of securing liberation in this very life, the middling goal of obtaining favorable rebirth and awakening the bodhisattva lineage in the next life, or at minimum cultivating virtues that leave no regrets at death—there is truly no greater self-deception possible.\n\nTo waste this opportunity by living aimlessly under the influence of the eight worldly concerns represents profound confusion about what to adopt and what to abandon. There is nothing more deluded than misunderstanding the fundamental choices before us. Therefore, one should not follow those who skillfully deceive with worldly enticements, nor surrender to confusion through weak discernment, but instead cultivate mindfulness and practice the pure Dharma with diligence.\n\nThis section forms part of a larger contemplation addressing the results of spiritual ignorance, disparaging the essence of delusion, and examining its causes—all aimed at motivating genuine practice.",

If, having understood the grave consequences of transgressing precepts and neglecting spiritual practice, I still make excuses like 'I'm too unintelligent to study,' 'I'm too angry to develop compassion,' or 'I'm too distracted to maintain diligence,' thus failing to train in the awakening mind (bodhicitta) and its practices, I will have cut off my own spiritual fortune. Then, at the moment when death approaches at the end of this life, knowing I will go to lower realms, I will scratch my chest in regret, thinking: 'How unfortunate!

Yet somehow, these formless afflictions have enslaved everyone—high and low, powerful and weak, myself and others—controlling us without our consent as if we were their servants. We serve attachment day and night without rest in pursuit of gain, honor, fame, and enjoyments; we serve anger even to the point of sacrificing our own lives; and whatever commands these afflictions issue, we fulfill without self-control, being tormented by the suffering of this servitude.

At most, these external enemies could harm my body and possessions in this life.\n\nHowever, these powerful external enemies, despite their combined might, would still not be able to lead me into and cast me into the intensely blazing fires of the Avīci hell. This is only possible if I am under the control of the afflictions in my own mindstream. These internal enemies of afflictive emotions are far more dangerous, as they can, in a single instant, cast me into the fire of Avīci—a fire so intense that it would reduce even Mount Meru to not even ashes upon contact.\n\nTherefore, the verse emphasizes that one should strive to defeat the true enemy—the afflictions within one's own mind—rather than focusing on external threats, no matter how formidable they might appear.",

If one indulges these afflictions by satisfying their every desire, their power only increases.\n\n'ཕྱིར་ཞིང་སྡུག་བསྔལ་གནོད་པ་བྱེད། །' (They repeatedly cause suffering and harm): Unlike external enemies who might become allies, these inner enemies of afflictions not only fail to bring benefit and happiness but instead repeatedly cause various sufferings and harms in this life and the next. Therefore, striving to overcome these afflictions, rather than indulging them, is itself the means to one's own happiness.",
    "<4><34> Combined Commentary\n\nThus, when these enemies of afflictions—which have continuously been enemies for a long time since beginningless time, without interruption even for a moment—and which are naturally hostile without any reason (just as fire is naturally hot), are the sole cause that greatly increases all collections of harms and sufferings in this and future lives, definitely establish residence in my heart, which is like a temple, how could I possibly be fearless and joyful in saṃsāra? When these afflictive enemies dwell in my heart, they cause varying degrees of harm: great harm if I fulfill their great commands, middling harm if I fulfill their middling commands, lesser harm if I fulfill their lesser commands, and no harm only if I do not fulfill them at all. There is no opportunity for happiness in saṃsāra, which is like a pit of fire or a nest of poisonous snakes, so it would be unreasonable to become attached to it. Instead, I should strive to destroy these afflictions.\n\nIt's worth noting that Bodhisattvas do not take rebirth in saṃsāra because they desire its suffering, but rather, moved by compassion, they take birth despite not wanting to, in order to benefit sentient beings. They cannot bear sentient beings' suffering in saṃsāra, yet they disregard their own suffering and do not abandon saṃsāra for the sake of others.",
    "<4><35> Combined Commentary\n\nThese afflictions function as the guardians of the prison of samsara's three realms, preventing liberation and appearing as executioners who take life in places such as the Reviving Hell and other lower realms. They cast beings into the prison-pits of hell and kill them in both lower and higher realms. If these disturbing emotions remain in my mind, caught in the net of attachment like prey ensnared in a hunter's net, dwelling within improper conceptualization and being unwilling to be abandoned, how could I possibly find happiness in this or future lives? Since there is no opportunity for physical or mental well-being while these afflictions reside in the web of clinging to the abode of mind, I must strive to eliminate them completely. This is what one should contemplate. This section continues with three parts: donning the armor for abandoning afflictions, not becoming discouraged by suffering, and establishing the antidotes.",
    "<4><36> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTherefore, as long as I have not definitively conquered these enemies - the afflictions - in direct perception, I will not abandon my diligence here in applying the antidotes, even at the cost of my life. Mere recognition of afflictions and understanding their faults is not sufficient; they must be completely abandoned through persistent effort, not merely temporarily suppressed.\n\nFor instance, even ordinary people who are filled with anger and inflated with pride, when faced with enemies who have caused only minor harm (such as stealing possessions, speaking harsh words, or causing small injuries), refuse to sleep until they have defeated those enemies. This illustrates how much more appropriate and necessary it is to apply diligence in overcoming the afflictions, which are the source of all unwanted experiences.\n\nThis section contains an illustrative comparison called 'a comparison with an actual entity,' showing that if worldly people display such determination against minor enemies, practitioners should show even greater resolve against the far more harmful enemies of afflictions.\n\nThe text belongs to a larger structure with three sections: donning the armor that can defeat afflictions without becoming discouraged by hardships; the benefits of striving to overcome afflictions; and why it is appropriate to apply oneself to the practice of defeating afflictions. This particular passage addresses the faults to be abandoned and the commitment required to overcome them.",
    "<4><37> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse describes afflictions (kleśas) as enemies who are naturally subject to suffering and death. These afflictions are referred to as 'objects of compassion' because they are pitiable enemies that suffer from their own nature of impermanence. The phrase 'when arrayed in battle formation' refers to the moment when one confronts these afflictions directly in the mind.\n\nJust as warriors in battle who desire to forcefully defeat their enemies endure the pain of being struck by arrows, spears, and weapons without retreating until they accomplish their goal, similarly, practitioners should not abandon their diligence in conquering the afflictions that are the root cause of all suffering. These afflictions are our 'natural enemies' that have been hostile from the moment of birth and are the definite enemies we wish to overcome.\n\nThe verse uses this military metaphor to argue that if ordinary soldiers can withstand physical pain and continue fighting physical enemies who will die naturally anyway, then spiritual practitioners should be even more determined to endure hardships (such as cold, hunger, thirst, or hundreds of other sufferings) while battling afflictions that cause endless cycles of suffering.\n\nThis passage forms part of a larger section explaining the reasonableness of enduring hardships because they are the cause of perfect benefit for oneself and others, and why one must fulfill one's previous spiritual commitments without becoming discouraged, losing heart, or growing lazy.",
    "<4><38> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse addresses how one should maintain unwavering courage when confronting afflictions, which are described as 'constant causes of all suffering' and 'natural enemies that are certain to be enemies by their very existence.' These afflictions are like inherent heat in fire—naturally destructive to anyone in whom they arise, whether superior or inferior, causing various kinds of suffering both in this life and future lives.\n\nFor one who is earnestly striving to overcome or abandon these afflictions—these definite, innate enemies that have been adversaries from birth—even when facing harm that becomes the cause of hundreds of sufferings (such as cold, hunger, thirst, having no food, no possessions, no clothing, or other adverse conditions), one should not become discouraged or disheartened.\n\nJust as in battle, when one earnestly wishes to defeat an opponent, one does not retreat despite the pain inflicted by weapons, similarly, how could I possibly become discouraged or dispirited thinking, 'Though I previously relied on antidotes to afflictions, I failed to eliminate them,' or become unenthusiastic in applying antidotes thinking, 'I still won't be able to eliminate them'?\n\nIt goes without saying that I will not become despondent or reluctant until these enemy afflictions are subdued—such discouragement is simply unacceptable when striving toward this essential spiritual goal. This represents the second point in a section addressing why enduring hardships is appropriate because it leads to the perfection of one's own purpose.",
    "<4><39> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf people proudly display the scars inflicted by enemies in battle without any significant purpose as if they were ornaments on their bodies, showing them off to others as signs of bravery and saying 'this happened to me at that time,' then why should the suffering that arises for me be considered harmful?\n\nI am diligently striving to practice the disciplines of a bodhisattva and genuinely working for the great purpose of accomplishing buddhahood—not just for myself but for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nFar from being harmful, such difficulties actually benefit me by purifying obscurations and advancing me on the path. These hardships are solely beneficial and therefore should be embraced rather than avoided.\n\nOne should reflect on this comparison: if worldly people take pride in wounds received for trivial or meaningless aims, how much more should I willingly accept challenges that arise while pursuing the supreme goal of enlightenment?",
    "<4><40> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Fishermen, butchers (who are of low caste), farmers, and others...' - This verse refers to people of humble occupations and sometimes lower social standing, who work hard merely for their own survival. These people pursue their livelihoods through difficult labor, some even engaging in harmful actions like killing fish or animals.\n\n'...who are merely concerned with their own livelihood...' - These individuals are focused only on earning enough for their own sustenance, not working for some greater purpose or the benefit of others. They work day without rest and night without sleep, wearing their feet bloody on stone and hands bloody on wood.\n\n'...can endure hardships such as cold and heat and so forth...' - Despite their limited goals, these workers bear tremendous physical discomfort, enduring harsh weather conditions including cold, heat, rain, and wind, along with other physical sufferings.\n\n'...then why should someone like myself not endure hardships undertaken for the sake of bringing happiness to all beings?' - This concluding question forms the central point: If ordinary people can withstand such adversities merely for their own survival, how much more should a spiritual practitioner be willing to endure difficulties when working for the vastly more noble purpose of establishing all sentient beings in complete happiness and ultimate great bliss—the state of Buddhahood? The implied answer is that one must certainly endure such hardships.",
    "<4><41> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ཕྱོགས་བཅུ་ནམ་མཁའི་མཐས་གཏུགས་པའི། །' (In the ten directions extending to the limits of space)\nPreviously, at the time of generating bodhicitta, I made a solemn pledge concerning all sentient beings without exception dwelling in the ten directions that extend to the limits of space—encompassing the entirety of the cosmos in all directions.\n\n'འགྲོ་བ་ཉོན་མོངས་ལས་བསྒྲལ་བར། །' (To liberate beings from afflictions)\nI vowed to liberate all these beings from afflictions and karma, to free those who are not freed, to bring relief to those who have not found relief, and to guide to complete nirvana those who have not attained it. This reflects my commitment to freeing all sentient beings from the obscurations that bind them to suffering.\n\n'དམ་བཅས་གང་ཚེ་བདག་ཉིད་ཀྱང་། །' (Having made this solemn pledge, even I myself)\nAt the very time of making this vast commitment and generating this resolve to benefit all beings, I made this solemn pledge without considering my own capacity or condition. This raises an important contradiction in my aspiration.\n\n'ཉོན་མོངས་རྣམས་ལས་མ་གྲོལ་བར། །' (Am not free from afflictions)\nYet I myself remain not liberated from afflictions such as attachment and other mental disturbances—not freed even slightly. Being still bound in saṃsāra myself, how could I—someone who doesn't even know their own capacity while remaining under the power of afflictions—not be considered insane when claiming to liberate all others? Let alone accomplishing others' welfare, I won't even be able to fulfill my own aims without first overcoming the afflictions in my own mindstream.",
    "<4><42> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**Without knowing the measure of my own capabilities, how is it not madness to speak so carelessly?**\n\nNot knowing my own capacity or mental limitations—while still being under the control of afflictions—how could my proclamation to liberate all beings not be like the speech of a madman? It is indeed like the behavior of someone who, while still bound and not free from water themselves, promises to free others from drowning. Since one who remains bound in saṃsāra cannot fully accomplish the welfare of others, this reveals the need to first address my own afflictions.\n\n**Therefore, to defeat the afflictions,**\n\nTherefore (the word 'de' indicates certainty, and 'ltas' shows comparison), since I have generated the mind intent on liberating all beings throughout the ten directions to the limits of space from afflictions and made this commitment, I must first liberate myself in order to liberate others. This section begins the explanation of striving to apply antidotes to afflictions.\n\n**I shall always remain unwavering.**\n\nFor the sake of defeating or eliminating all the enemies of afflictions without exception, I must strive with diligence, making a firm commitment to never turn back from relying on the antidotes. I should cultivate focused dedication to these antidotes to afflictions while holding enmity toward the afflictions themselves, vanquishing them in battle. This unwavering effort in both thought and deed constitutes the third point of the teaching.",
    "<4><43> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འདི་ལ་བདག་གིས་ཞེན་བྱ་ཞིང་། །' (To this I shall cling)\n\nRegarding the antidote to afflictions, 'I shall cling to this' means I will deliberately rely upon the antidote with diligence. Having regarded afflictions as enemies, one must develop firm attachment to the methods that overcome them. This deliberate clinging to the antidote is a strategic approach at the beginner's stage.\n\n'ཁོན་དུ་བཟུང་ནས་གཡུལ་སྤྲད་དེ། །' (Having harbored enmity, engage in battle)\n\n'Having harbored enmity' toward afflictions that have harmed me since beginningless time, I will 'engage in battle' to defeat them. This means actively confronting the afflictions through the engagement between what is to be abandoned and its antidote.\n\n'རྣམ་པ་དེ་འདྲའི་ཉོན་མོངས་པ། །' (This type of affliction)\n\nOne might wonder: 'Since this attachment to the antidote and resentment toward afflictions are themselves forms of attachment and aversion, shouldn't they also be abandoned?' This apparent contradiction refers to those states that take the form of clinging to the antidote and harboring resentment toward what is to be abandoned.\n\n'ཉོན་མོངས་འཇོམས་བྱེད་མ་གཏོགས་སོ། །' (Excepting that which destroys afflictions)\n\nSuch affliction-like states that destroy other afflictions are excepted from what is to be abandoned at the beginner's stage. As the Great Commentary states, 'but that itself is not [an affliction]' - or more precisely, it belongs to the category of antidotes. However, it is understood that eventually, when the primary afflictions are exhausted, these strategic attachments and aversions—being cognitive obscurations—will also need to be abandoned, as the battle between what is to be abandoned and its antidote becomes unnecessary.",
    "<4><44> Combined Commentary\n\nEven if I were to be burned and killed, or even if my head were cut off and fall to the ground, it would be preferable to that. This merely means discarding this life's body, whereas the alternative—bowing to the enemy of afflictions such as attachment and aversion—would produce great suffering such as hell and so forth, and obstruct the attainment of desired aims.\n\nTherefore, from the very beginning, we should repeatedly resolve that in all respects, I shall not bow down to—that is, come under the power of—the enemy of afflictions. I should never surrender to or be controlled by these afflictions.\n\nSome might object that even if afflictions were removed once, they could regain their strength like worldly enemies and cause harm again, and therefore one should accommodate them accordingly. However, this verse emphasizes that no matter what happens, we must maintain our resolve against mental afflictions, as they are the true source of our suffering.\n\nWhen one completely uproots the afflictions in one's own mindstream, there is no basis for them to remain. Since they arise from mistaken causes, they can be abandoned through diligent application, and when uprooted completely, there is no basis anywhere for them to remain, and therefore they should be abandoned.",
    "<4><45> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'An ordinary enemy who is expelled from one's territory' refers to how worldly adversaries, when banished from a region, can still pose a threat later on.\n\n'May dwell in other regions and take hold there' shows that conventional enemies can relocate to different territories and establish themselves in these new places.\n\n'Having gained strength, they then return' indicates that ordinary enemies, after regrouping and gathering power elsewhere, can come back to seek revenge or cause harm again.\n\n'But the enemy of afflictions is not like that' distinguishes mental afflictions (kleśas) from conventional enemies, emphasizing their fundamentally different nature.\n\nUnlike worldly foes, afflictions such as attachment, when completely uprooted by the noble path and the wisdom that understands their lack of inherent existence, have nowhere to go or reside—they cannot gather strength elsewhere or return to harm one. Once these mental afflictions are thoroughly eliminated through spiritual practice, they are permanently dispelled, like darkness vanishing when light enters a cave.",
    "<4><46> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Afflictions are to be abandoned by the eye of wisdom' - These mental afflictions (kleśas) are easily defeated when analyzed properly, which is why they are referred to with contemptuous language as 'afflictions.' As stated in the Great Commentary, these afflictions are rootless and can be abandoned by seeing ultimate truth as it is. They are specifically abandoned through the eye of wisdom that realizes selflessness and understands their lack of inherent nature, just as darkness is instantly dispelled when sunlight enters a dark cave.\n\n'Where will they go when removed from my mind?' - Once expelled from one's mind, which is like a temple, these afflictions have nowhere to go. Since they arise from misapprehension, once they are uprooted by wisdom that realizes emptiness, they have no basis upon which to remain.\n\n'Where would they dwell and return to harm me?' - From what location could these afflictions gather strength and return to cause harm? They cannot return or regain strength once truly eliminated, as they have no independent existence or inherent nature.\n\n'It is only my weak intellect failing to make effort' - Therefore, I, with my feeble intellect, have merely failed to exert proper effort toward abandoning these afflictions. If I were to make such effort, these afflictions would be easier to overcome than external enemies. It is impossible not to eliminate them if one makes a genuine effort to analyze their nature with wisdom.",
    "<4><47> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe afflictions such as attachment and aversion do not abide in external objects like enemies and friends or forms. If they did exist in objects, then just like oneself, others who see those same objects would necessarily develop attachment and aversion, and even Arhats would generate afflictions when seeing forms, which is absurd.\n\nNor do these afflictions abide in the internal sense faculties like eyes or in the collections of consciousnesses, because even when sense faculties and consciousness function together, afflictions do not always arise. When contemplating the nature of reality, even though the eyes exist, afflictions are not observed.\n\nNor do they abide in the space between objects and sense faculties, as space is empty and provides no basis for abiding. Nor can they exist elsewhere, such as in other sentient beings or in the environment.\n\nIf so, then where do these afflictions—enemies since beginningless time—abide while causing harm to oneself and all beings in this and future lives? When examined, they are not established as truly harmful.\n\nThese afflictions, when analyzed and investigated, appear but lack inherent nature, like an illusion with three characteristics: arising from conditions, appearing to the mind, yet lacking inherent existence. They are like magical illusions: while empty of inherent existence, they appear as if inherently existent.\n\nTherefore, abandon the fear in your heart that you cannot overcome afflictions or completely eradicate what is inherently established. Instead of chasing after objects like throwing a stone at a dog, be like one who throws a stone at a lion—directly recognize whatever afflictive thought arises in your mind and investigate it. Generate and rely upon diligence to understand that afflictions lack inherent nature and to eliminate them by developing the wisdom that realizes emptiness.\n\nWhy would you needlessly allow yourself to be harmed by the suffering of hell and other lower realms? While having the capacity to overcome afflictions, it is unreasonable to subject yourself to harm in lower rebirths.",
    "<4><48> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nHaving thus reflected well on the teachings of mindfulness explained above (དེ་ལྟར་རྣམ་བསམས་ཇི་སྐད་བཤད་པ་ཡི།), one should strive diligently to practice and accomplish the bodhisattva's trainings—moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom—as taught in the Buddha's sutras and treatises (བསླབ་པ་བསྒྲུབ་པའི་ཆེད་དུ་འབད་པར་བྱ།). \n\nThis is explained through analogies: the Buddha is like a skilled physician; the Dharma is like medicine; moral discipline is like proper diet and lifestyle; afflictions such as attachment are like diseases; and the practitioner is like the patient.\n\nIf one does not listen to the physician's instructions (སྨན་པའི་ངག་མ་མཉན་ན་སྨན་དག་གིས།), meaning if one does not follow the Buddha's teachings with diligent effort in what to adopt and abandon, then just as a patient who requires treatment cannot be cured (བཅོས་དགོས་ནད་པ་སོས་པ་ག་ལ་ཡོད།), similarly, one cannot be liberated from afflictions and suffering.\n\nAs stated in the Letter to a Friend: 'Mindfulness is the abode of the nectar of immortality, while heedlessness is the place of death.' And as mentioned in the Śikṣāsamuccaya, one should protect and increase the gifts of one's body, possessions, and virtues dedicated to all sentient beings. Therefore, one should always remain respectfully mindful and strive with great diligence to preserve bodhicitta and follow the words of the great physician, the Buddha.",
    "<4><49> Combined Commentary on the Fourth Chapter of the Bodhicaryāvatāra\n\nHaving thoroughly contemplated the teachings on vigilance (apramāda) or conscientiousness (bag yod) as described in the previous chapters, one must now strive diligently to practice by engaging in efforts to accomplish the threefold training of the superior path: ethical discipline, meditative concentration, and wisdom.\n\nThis practice of conscientiousness is essential for preserving the bodhicitta and the trainings previously described. Without such diligence, our spiritual efforts will not bear fruit.\n\nThe Buddha illustrates this principle through a medical analogy: the Buddha himself is like a skilled physician; the holy Dharma of study, contemplation, and meditation is like medicine; the training in ethical discipline or vows is primarily like proper diet and conduct; afflictions such as attachment and aversion are like diseases; and we ourselves are like patients.\n\nIf we do not observe ethical discipline by diligently engaging in what should be adopted and abandoned, then just as patients will not be cured from diseases even after consuming excellent medicines if they don't follow the physician's instructions, similarly the Dharma will not benefit us. However, if we properly apply ourselves to practice, then just as diseases are pacified through properly relying on medicine, we will attain the great happiness of liberation from all suffering.\n\nAs the Letter to a Friend states: 'Vigilance is the abode of the nectar of immortality, while non-vigilance is the place of death, thus proclaimed the Sage. Therefore, to increase your virtuous qualities, always maintain vigilance with respect.'\n\nWhen one's mindstream is freed from the turbidity of faults, and virtues do not decline but continue to increase, this depends entirely on cultivating conscientiousness. Therefore, the wise should always remain conscientious.\n\nThis concludes the fourth chapter entitled 'Teaching on Vigilance' or 'Heedfulness' from the Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Bodhicaryāvatāra)."

As the Śikṣāsamuccaya indicates, one must first rely on an authentic spiritual guide, train in what should be adopted and rejected through study, and become skilled in properly understanding these distinctions. Without such knowledge, what would one remember or practice?\n\n**རབ་ཏུ་བསྒྲིམས་ནས་སེམས་བསྲུང་སྟེ། །** (Should, with utmost diligence, guard the mind)\nWith utmost diligence and vigilance, one should protect the mind from being agitated toward distorted objects and from moving in improper directions. This vigilance involves the essence of mindfulness—not forgetting the objects of adoption and rejection—and introspective awareness, which means repeatedly examining one's conduct of body, speech, and mind in all circumstances, whether in a crowd or alone.\n\n**སེམས་འདི་བསྲུང་བར་མ་བྱས་ན། །** (If one does not guard this mind)\nIf this mind is not protected from afflictions and distractions through mindfulness and awareness, one will fall into error. The mind is like a wild stallion, mindfulness like a rope, and introspective awareness like a watchman. Without these safeguards, the mind will run astray. Since others cannot know our negative thoughts, we must be our own teachers in guarding our minds.\n\n**བསླབ་པ་བསྲུང་བར་ཡོང་མི་ནུས། །** (It will be utterly impossible to protect the training)\nEven if one hopes to maintain discipline without deterioration, it will be utterly impossible to do so if the mind remains unguarded. Merely constraining one's body and speech out of fear, or temporarily treating discipline as a burden, will not ultimately succeed. Therefore, protecting the mind is of utmost importance for anyone wishing to maintain the three precious trainings of the path.",
    "<5><2> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse compares the mind to an elephant, emphasizing the dangers of an uncontrolled mind. Let me explain it sentence by sentence:\n\n'སེམས་ཀྱི་གླང་པོ་ཡན་བཏང་བས། །' (When the elephant of the mind is let loose)\nThis first line refers to the wild elephant of one's own mind that follows past habitual tendencies, anticipates future conceptualizations, and releases present thoughts into the realm of conditions. When this mind-elephant is left unrestrained and allowed to roam freely upon mistaken objects, one accumulates negative karma.\n\n'མནར་མེད་གནོད་པ་བྱེད་པ་ལྟར། །' (It causes harm like that of the Avīci hell)\nThis unrestrained mind leads to intense suffering comparable to being boiled and burned in the Avīci hell and other hell realms in future lives. The harm caused by an unchecked mind is equated with the most extreme forms of suffering.\n\n'གླང་ཆེན་མ་ཐུལ་མྱོས་པ་ཡིས། །' (A wild, intoxicated elephant)\nThis refers to an actual physical elephant in our world that has not been tamed through training and is intoxicated with alcohol, such as war elephants in India that might be sent against enemies to cause destruction.\n\n'འདི་ན་དེ་འདྲའི་གནོད་མི་བྱེད། །' (Does not cause such harm in this world)\nEven the destruction caused by an untamed, intoxicated physical elephant in this human world cannot compare to the suffering caused by the uncontrolled mind. The damage from a physical elephant is limited, whereas the harm from an uncontrolled mind can lead to rebirth in hell realms.\n\nThis verse constitutes a brief explanation of why one should strive diligently to guard the mind, as the consequences of an unrestrained mind far exceed any physical harm in our world.",
    "<5><3> Combined Commentary\n\nIf one tightly binds the elephant of the mind—which is intoxicated by desires—with the rope of mindfulness in all three doors (body, speech, and mind), then all fears will cease and all virtues will be accomplished. \n\nBy 'rope of mindfulness,' we mean not forgetting the objects of adoption and rejection through all channels of body, speech, and mind: without tracing the path already gone, without anticipating the future ahead, and without allowing present awareness to be released into distractions, but instead maintaining proper mental focus on the pillar of meditation.\n\nWhen the mind is firmly bound to virtuous objects in this way, all fears of this and future lives will disappear completely, and all virtuous actions that benefit oneself and others—encompassing the paths of the three types of beings—will be accomplished as easily as if placed directly into one's hand.\n\nTherefore, one should never allow mindfulness to deteriorate from the object of virtue, as this practice is the key to both abandoning fear and accomplishing all positive qualities.",
    "<5><4> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Tigers, lions, elephants, bears, snakes, and all enemies' refers to the various fears we face in this life, including wild animals and human adversaries such as thieves and robbers. These represent immediate physical dangers in our present existence.\n\n'Guardians of hell realms' points to the fears of the next life, including the terrifying servants of Yama and other fearsome beings who oversee punishment in the hell realms according to Buddhist cosmology.\n\n'Witches and likewise demons' refers to harmful beings that threaten us in both this life and the next—sorceresses who use spells such as the ḍākinīs, those who send harmful spirits, and rākṣasas who steal life-force and drain vitality.\n\nAll these dangers, however, are ultimately dependent on the mind. When one binds one's mind to virtuous objects of attention through mindfulness, these threats become powerless. In fact, these fearsome beings are merely imputations of one's own mind—they exist as threats primarily through the way we conceptualize them. When the mind is tamed through mindfulness and awareness, and one refrains from engaging in misdeeds, it's as if all these beings are tamed as well. This underscores the fundamental Buddhist teaching that our experience of reality ultimately depends on the state of our own mind.",
    "<5><5> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**སེམས་འདི་གཅིག་པུ་བཏགས་པ་ཡིས། །** (By tethering this single mind)\nBy tethering this single mind to virtuous objects through the rope of mindfulness, one effectively binds all potential sources of harm. When one restrains one's mind alone with mindfulness and binds it firmly, all harmful and malicious beings become bound as well and cannot harm oneself.\n\n**དེ་དག་ཐམས་ཅད་བཏགས་པར་འགྱུར། །** (All those become bound)\nWhen the mind is thus tethered, one can avert all causes of fear—from tigers, lions, elephants, bears, venomous snakes, and human enemies in this life, to the guardians of hell realms, harm-inflicting sorceresses, and other frightening entities in future lives. These all become as if bound and cannot cause even the slightest harm. As explained further in the text, when traveling on paths with mindfulness and awareness, carefully examining one's surroundings, one will not encounter dangerous animals, as one is protected by worldly deities and guardians of virtue.\n\n**སེམས་འདི་གཅིག་པུ་བཏུལ་བས་ན། །** (By taming this single mind)\nWhen one's mind alone is tamed through loving-kindness, compassion, bodhicitta, or meditative concentration, one disciplines it through mindfulness and vigilance, preventing it from engaging in wrongdoing. As stated in the Jātaka: 'Due to the nature of compassion that moistens like moisture itself, their minds became free from harming one another; even fierce predators behaved like ascetics.'\n\n**དེ་དག་ཐམས་ཅད་ཐུལ་བར་འགྱུར། །** (All those become tamed)\nBy taming the mind, all fears of this and future lives become tamed and cause no harm. This transformative power is illustrated by examples such as Bodhisattva Asanga, who witnessed lambs and wolves playing together affectionately before him, and the great Indian siddha Saraha and others, who rode on lions adorned with venomous snakes. Therefore, one should strive diligently to discipline the mind, as this is the foundation for overcoming all dangers.",
    "<5><6> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Thus, all fears' refers to all the terrifying experiences of both this life and future ones, including the fears of death, illness, poverty, and the lower realms. 'And immeasurable sufferings' encompasses the countless physical and mental torments experienced by sentient beings across all realms of existence. 'Arise from the mind' indicates that these fears and sufferings originate from our own distracted and deluded mind that has engaged in sinful, non-virtuous actions. 'As taught by the One who speaks the truth' refers to the Buddha himself, who speaks only truth and never falsehood about all objects of knowledge.\n\nThis teaching is supported by several scriptures: The Ratnamegha Sūtra (Precious Cloud Sutra) states: 'When the mind is controlled, all phenomena come under control' and 'If one masters the mind itself, one masters all phenomena.' Other teachings affirm: 'Whether virtuous or non-virtuous, actions are accumulated by the mind' and 'The mind precedes all phenomena; if one thoroughly understands the mind, one thoroughly understands all phenomena.' The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra (Discourse on the Correct Collection of Dharma) further confirms: 'All phenomena depend on the mind.' From the Smṛtyupasthāna comes: 'The mind is the enemy, the great enemy. There is no enemy other than the mind. Just as rough wood burns itself, so the mind is burned by one's own mind.'",
    "<5><7> Combined Commentary\n\nThe weapons of the hell realms, such as cutting implements like swords and axes, forests of sword-leaves, and grinding instruments like mortars—who has intentionally created these for the purpose of tormenting beings? Indeed, there is no external creator like Īśvara who purposefully commissioned them. The burning iron ground of an intensely ablaze nature—who has created this and for what purpose? Again, there is no external creator. And those apparitions of women who make beings climb up and down the Sword-Leaved Mountain, whom one previously desired and engaged with wrongly—from what have these female hosts arisen? They have not arisen from anything external.\n\nSince it would be illogical for these torments to arise without causes, all these arise from one's own previous negative mind, as taught in the Buddha's sacred dharma texts like the Smṛtyupasthāna, which states: 'The mind is the greatest enemy within enemies; there is no enemy other than this.' Regarding the term 'groups of women' (mo tshogs), the Great Commentary and Vairocana explain it this way, and since Devaśarman also explains it as 'women,' the alternative reading 'mass of fire' (me tshogs) is incorrect.\n\nSome who have not thoroughly studied logic attempt to deny karma by arguing that hungry ghosts merely perceive pus and blood where humans see pure water, but nothing actually exists there. This argument is extremely unreasonable. If you follow this reasoning to its conclusion, you would eventually have to deny the existence of hell itself, thus rejecting karma and its effects. May you not adopt such nihilistic views that deny the suffering experiences in the hells, which all arise from one's own sinful mind.",
    "<5><8> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དེ་འདྲ་དེ་དག་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱང་། །སྡིག་སེམས་ཡིན་པར་ཐུབ་པས་གསུངས། །'\n(All those various fearsome harms are taught by the Sage to arise from the sinful mind.)\n\nAll those various fearsome harms and sufferings experienced in the hells and elsewhere are born from the power of habituation to one's own sinful, non-virtuous mind, as the Buddha, the Blessed One, the Sage, taught in the sutras. As stated in the Sutra Distinguishing Beings: 'The blazing, hot iron ground, completely pervaded by flaming tongues of fire; the body cut into a hundred pieces by sharp iron saws—these arise from the minds of those who commit sins of body, speech, and mind.' If these sufferings did not arise from one's own previous sinful mind, then who would have intentionally created the weapons in the hells - the spears, swords, and blazing iron ground? They weren't deliberately created by any external agent like Ishvara, and causeless origination is untenable. The Buddha taught this truth in his holy dharma teachings like the Mindfulness Applications (Sṃṛtyupasthāna).\n\n'དེ་ལྟར་འཇིག་རྟེན་གསུམ་པོ་ན། །སེམས་ལས་འཇིགས་པ་གཞན་འགའ་མེད། །'\n(Thus, in the three worlds, there is no fear other than the mind.)\n\nThus, in the three worlds—whether understood as the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm, or as the realms below ground, on the ground, and above ground—there are no other fears whatsoever that do not arise from the power of one's own deluded mind. As stated in the Mindfulness Application: 'The mind is the great enemy among enemies; there is no enemy other than this.' Therefore, if one does not allow one's own mind to fall under the influence of distraction and delusion but guards it well, all harms of this and future lives will be eliminated. Since all faults depend on the mind, there is nothing more frightening in all three worlds than what is created by one's own mind. This understanding leads to the next point: just as all suffering depends on the mind, all virtuous qualities to be accomplished by the Bodhisattva—the six perfections of generosity, moral discipline, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom—also depend primarily on the mind.",
    "<5><9> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse examines the true meaning of the perfection of generosity (dāna-pāramitā). \n\n'If making all sentient beings free from poverty is the perfection of generosity...' - The verse begins by proposing a hypothetical definition of the perfection of generosity: that it means eliminating all material poverty from the world and leaving no beggars or destitute beings.\n\n'Then given that even today many beggars and destitute beings still exist...' - This line highlights the empirical observation that poverty and suffering still exist in our world.\n\n'How could the previous protectors (the Blessed Buddhas) have perfected the paramita of giving?' - This creates a logical contradiction. If perfection of generosity required eliminating all poverty, then since poverty still exists, the Buddhas of the past could not have attained this perfection—which is untenable, as we know they did perfect generosity.\n\nThe underlying message is that true generosity exists within the inner mind rather than being defined by external results. The perfection of generosity is not measured by whether all beings are free from poverty, but by the complete relinquishment of attachment and the development of unconditional generosity in one's mind. This understanding resolves the apparent contradiction and clarifies how the Buddhas truly perfected the paramita of giving despite the continued existence of poverty in the world.",
    "<5><10> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n'Whatever material possessions one has—body, enjoyments—or all possessions' refers to all inner and outer possessions that one could give. 'Together with the fruits' means giving without expectation of return in this life or ripening results in future lives, also including the merit that results from such giving. 'For all beings' indicates that the recipients include all sentient beings without distinction—high or low, rich or poor. 'With the mind of giving' shows that the perfection of giving is achieved through developing and habituating a giving mind that is completely free from miserliness or attachment. As the Akṣayamati Sūtra states: 'What is the perfection of giving? It is the intention to give all possessions together with their fruits to others.' 'Therefore, that is indeed the mind itself' means that the perfection of giving does not depend on the quantity of objects given but rather on one's mental state—the giving mind that lacks attachment and miserliness. The term 'perfection' refers to giving that is embraced by non-conceptualization of the three spheres (giver, gift, and recipient). Thus, the perfection of giving is essentially a state of mind itself, achieved when one has reached the ultimate level of habituation to giving to all sentient beings.",

All commentaries agree that it is fundamentally impossible to physically protect all beings by relocating them to some safe place.\n\n'སྤོང་བའི་སེམས་ནི་ཐོབ་པ་ལས། །' (From attaining the mind of renunciation)\n\nThis line indicates that the perfection of ethical discipline arises from attaining the mind of renunciation. The commentaries emphasize that ethical discipline exists when one has mastered the mind that abandons harmful intentions, the intention to take what is not given, and attachment to objects such as women. Without such a mind of renunciation, merely not committing infractions does not constitute ethical discipline.\n\n'ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས་ཕ་རོལ་ཕྱིན་པར་བཤད། །' (The perfection of ethical discipline is explained)\n\nThis concluding line states that the perfection of ethical discipline is explained as arising from this renouncing mind. All commentaries reference the same sutra quote: 'What is the perfection of ethical discipline? It is the intention (or mental attitude) that abandons harm to others.' This confirms that the perfection of ethical discipline is not defined by the absence of beings to harm or the cessation of harmful actions, but by the internal commitment to never harm others even at the cost of one's own life.",

Just as there is no place one can go where there is no sky, similarly there is no place one can go where there are no beings who might cause harm or provoke anger.\n\n**'It is impossible to subdue them all.'**\nFrom the very beginning, it has never been possible to eliminate or destroy all these harmful beings. One cannot create a situation where there are no objects for anger, as unruly sentient beings will always exist in limitless numbers.\n\n**'But if one conquers this single angry mind,'**\nSince the patience practice depends upon our own mind rather than external conditions, the focus should be on overcoming or abandoning the inner angry mind through the cultivation of patience. This is where true liberation lies.\n\n**'It is as if all those enemies have been conquered.'**\nWhen one has conquered anger alone, it is equivalent to having conquered all external enemies. By subduing our own angry mind, we perfect the practice of patience, making all those outer enemies effectively neutralized, regardless of their continued existence.",
    "<5><13> Combined Commentary:\n\nFor example, although one might desire to cover all this surface of the earth with soft leather to protect against harm from thorns and other harmful objects, where would one find enough leather of that magnitude? It would be impossible—how could one possibly have sufficient leather for such an enormous task? However, there is a practical solution: if one simply covers one's own feet with leather the size of just a shoe sole, it accomplishes the same purpose as if the entire surface of the earth were covered with leather. By wearing shoes with leather soles, one can walk anywhere without being harmed by thorns and other sharp objects on the ground, making it effectively the same as having covered the entire earth. This illustrates how a small, targeted solution can be just as effective as an impossibly large one.",
    "<5><14> Combined Commentary:\n\nSimilarly, I cannot eliminate, ward off, or turn back all external harmful things that exist in the world. Instead, I must turn back this one thing alone—my internal angry mind—and prevent it from generating anger toward those objects. By turning my mind away from anger through familiarity with patience, this perfection will be accomplished. What need is there for me to stop or ward off other external sources of harm? What purpose is there in trying to prevent others from harming me? There is no need and no purpose in doing so, as I cannot turn them back anyway. It is more meaningful to control my own mind, for as will be explained in the next section regarding diligence, the mind is also of primary importance.",
    "<5><15> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nDiligence is also present within the mind. If one generates a single, clear-minded state (གསལ་གཅིག་བསྐྱེད) - such as loving-kindness or compassion that is not vague but intense like a mother's love for her only child - what is the fruit (འབྲས་བུ་གང) of that? The result is rebirth in the Brahma realm and other such places (ཚངས་ལ་སོགས་པ་ཡིན་པ་ལྟར) in the form realm, attaining exceptional happiness.\n\nSimilarly, when one accomplishes various virtues through physical and verbal effort (ལུས་ངག་བཅས་པའི་འབྲས་བུ་མང), there are many fruits. However, if these actions are not connected with a powerful mind, then due to weak conduct (སྤྱོད་པ་ཞན་པས) with little enthusiasm, such actions do not produce similar results (དེ་ལྟ་མིན) like rebirth in the first dhyāna and Brahma realms.\n\nThis is supported by examples in the Nirvana Sutra, where a mother developing great compassion for her dying infant, or a mother and child generating mutual love while being swept away by water, can be reborn in the Brahma realm through that single clear thought alone. Therefore, the power of the mind is paramount, and meditative absorption itself is accomplished by mind alone.",

It is called 'secret' because it is not the domain of ordinary beings and must be concealed within one's own mind until properly realized. This refers to the fundamental nature of mind that transcends elaborations such as arising, ceasing, and abiding, which is the highest purpose of spiritual practice.\n\nབདེ་ཐོབ་སྡུག་བསྔལ་གཞོམ་འདོད་ཀྱང་། ། (Though they desire to attain happiness and overcome suffering,)\n\nThis line explains that even though practitioners may sincerely wish to attain the bliss of nirvana and completely eradicate all sufferings of samsara, without understanding the mind's empty nature, their efforts remain insufficient. Even Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas, who realize the selflessness of persons but not of phenomena, cannot fully transcend suffering because this deeper truth remains secret to them as well.\n\nདེ་དག་དོན་མེད་གྱི་ནར་འཁྱམ། ། (They will wander aimlessly without purpose.)\n\nThose who fail to recognize the empty, selfless nature of mind will wander in futility and meaninglessness in cyclic existence despite their spiritual aspirations. As stated in the Great Commentary, this wisdom is beyond the reach of ordinary beings, and as mentioned in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'All practices of bodhisattvas depend on their own mind.' The Detailed Explanation notes that 'those endowed with wisdom move freely like birds in the sky,' indicating that wisdom, which is the main essence of mind itself, liberates us from aimless wandering. All methods, aspirations, powers, and primordial awareness derive from this wisdom and are thus centered on understanding the mind's true nature.",

Both avoiding faults and accomplishing virtuous qualities depend fundamentally on the state of one's mind.\n\n'ལེགས་བཟུང་ལེགས་པར་བསྲུང་བར་བྱ། །' (Should be well grasped and well protected)\nI should excellently grasp this mind through mindfulness that does not forget the bases of what to adopt and reject, and must excellently protect it through vigilance that repeatedly examines body and mind.

These negative people can be likened to harmful conditions that would aggravate a physical wound.\n\n'སེམས་ཀྱི་རྨ་འདི་རྟག་ཏུ་བསྲུང་། །' (One must always protect this wound of the mind.)\n\nThe mind is compared to a wound that needs constant protection. Just as a physical wound deteriorates and festers when exposed to harmful conditions, the mind, when exposed to objects of desire or aversion, gives rise to attachment and hatred. If one fails to guard this 'wound of the mind,' it will produce great suffering and cut off one's chance for higher rebirth and liberation. Therefore, one must always protect the mind from situations that give rise to afflictions, regardless of time or circumstance.",
    "<5><20> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse presents a logical argument: When one becomes frightened by even the small suffering of a physical wound and takes precautions to protect it, why then would one not protect the wound of one's mind? The comparison is striking—if we guard minor bodily injuries with such care, we should be even more vigilant about protecting our minds from negativities and downfalls that could lead to far greater suffering. Specifically, those who fear the terrible consequences of rebirth in destructive realms such as the Saṃghāta (Crushing) hell—where beings are crushed between mountains and their bodies are completely smashed—should be especially motivated to guard their minds. Just as we treat physical wounds with immediate attention to prevent infection or worsening pain, we must protect our mental 'wounds' through mindfulness and awareness, preventing the mind from leaking outward toward harmful states. By contemplating these great disadvantages of leaving the mind unguarded, we recognize the urgency of mental protection as far more crucial than physical protection.",

Similarly, it is better to allow other virtuous actions of body and speech, whatever they may be, to decline rather than letting the mind deteriorate. But for the sake of guarding precepts, this yogic discipline of protecting the mind through mindfulness and awareness should never be allowed to deteriorate—the great vehicle mind must never be abandoned.\n\nAs it is taught in the Instructions to the King: 'I shall give away my wealth to protect my body. I shall give away both wealth and body to protect my life. I shall give away wealth, body, and likewise life—giving up everything to protect the Dharma.'

    "<5><23> Combined Commentary\n\nTo those who wish to guard their mind, I, Śāntideva, join my palms together and earnestly implore: 'With every effort, protect mindfulness—which prevents forgetting the objects of adoption and rejection and means not forgetting the aspects of virtue upon which you are focusing—and introspective awareness—which engages in actions of the three doors (body, speech, and mind) after careful examination and means examining the states of your three doors.' Protect these two qualities even at the cost of your life! I say this not out of faith in ourselves, but because this is extremely important for mental protection.\n\nThe next section has multiple parts addressing: the disadvantages of lacking introspective awareness and mindfulness, which include (1) having little power in any undertaking, (2) wisdom not becoming pure, (3) ethical discipline not becoming pure, (4) previously accumulated virtues being destroyed, and (5) obstructing the accomplishment of virtues not yet performed.

Commentary 1 describes this as 'disturbed by forgetfulness and lack of awareness,' while Commentaries 2 and 3 specifically mention confusion 'about what to adopt and what to reject.'\n\n'lacks the capacity for all virtuous actions' - All commentaries agree that mental confusion renders one powerless in virtuous activities.

Without vigilant awareness, all three forms of wisdom cannot be properly retained or developed.\n\n'གློ་རྡོལ་བུམ་པའི་ཆུ་བཞིན་དུ། །' (Are like water in a leaking vessel)\nHere a powerful metaphor is employed - comparing wisdom without vigilant awareness to water poured into a broken or leaking pot. Just as water gradually drains away from a damaged vessel until nothing remains inside, wisdom cannot be contained in a mind lacking proper attentiveness. This simile vividly illustrates how spiritual knowledge dissipates when not protected by mindfulness.\n\n'དྲན་པ་ལ་ནི་དེ་མི་གནས། །' (They do not remain in memory)\nThe final line explains the consequence - without vigilant awareness, the realized meanings and insights from hearing, contemplation, and meditation will not remain in one's memory but will be forgotten. Even if one initially gains understanding, without proper mindfulness it cannot be retained, leading to a deterioration of wisdom. As Ge-lha notes, one does not clearly experience the virtue of these practices. This suggests that ethical discipline and spiritual progress are also wasted without proper vigilant awareness.",

Introspective awareness (or vigilance) is crucial for examining one's own conduct to ensure one is following the trainings properly. Without this quality monitoring one's actions, speech, and thoughts, even the most learned and faithful practitioners can become contaminated with the impurities of downfalls. Therefore, one should strive diligently to guard mindfulness and maintain introspective awareness at all times. This constitutes the fourth point in the text's structure of advice on maintaining proper spiritual practice.",
    "<5><27> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse explains that those who lack alertness (asamprajanya) or vigilance are metaphorically compared to robbers or bandits. These harmful states follow in the wake of degraded or declined mindfulness (smṛti), which normally functions as a guardian that remembers what should be adopted and abandoned. The verse warns that even though one may have previously accumulated merit and virtuous deeds, these afflictions—like desire, anger, pride, and envy—act as thieves who seize one's possessions. Just as a robber might steal material wealth and even take one's life, these mental afflictions steal the wealth of virtue that has been gathered, cutting off the possibility of favorable rebirth. Consequently, despite having collected merit, one becomes impoverished of virtue and proceeds to lower realms or unfortunate states of existence. This illustrates the critical importance of maintaining both mindfulness and vigilance to protect one's accumulated positive karma.",

Just as thieves operate in groups to overpower travelers, these afflictions work together to overwhelm our virtuous intentions.\n\n'གླགས་སྐབས་ཚོལ་བར་བྱེད་པ་སྟེ། །' (Seek opportunities to cause harm) indicates that these afflictions are constantly watching and waiting for openings in our mindfulness. Like thieves assessing the right moment—day, night, or whenever convenient—afflictions seek moments of weakness when our introspective awareness is lacking. They are always probing for opportunities to infiltrate our consciousness.\n\n'གླགས་རྙེད་གྱུར་ནས་དགེ་འཕྲོག་ཅིང་། །' (Once they find an opening, they steal virtuous deeds) means that when these afflictions discover a gap in our vigilance, they steal the accumulated wealth of virtue we have gathered. They rob us of our positive karma and virtuous causes, undoing the good we have accomplished through practice.\n\n'བདེ་འགྲོའི་སྲོག་ཀྱང་འཇོམས་པར་བྱེད། །' (And destroy even the life that would lead to fortunate rebirth) shows that beyond merely stealing virtue, these afflictions ultimately destroy our very chance for higher rebirth and liberation. As stated in the Great Commentary: 'Because there is no provision of virtue,' we lose the causes for fortunate rebirths and are left vulnerable to lower realms. The afflictions thus destroy not just individual virtuous acts but our entire spiritual potential.\n\nTo counter this, one must cultivate vigilant introspection, constantly examining, 'How is the condition of my three doors [of body, speech, and mind] right now?' Through diligent mindfulness and introspective awareness, we can protect ourselves from these destructive thieves of the mind.",
    "<5><29> Combined Commentary:\n\nTherefore, for that reason, one should place mindfulness—which does not forget the objects to be adopted and rejected—at the door of one's mind's house, that is, at the entrance where the mind engages with objects. Since the absence of vigilance gives rise to many faults, one should never, at any time, allow this mindfulness to go elsewhere or outside of the mental doorway. This means that by relying on mindfulness, one must protect one's mind from wandering to the objects of the six consciousnesses.\n\nIf mindfulness is forgotten and has departed—if the mind wanders to objects—one should immediately recall the drawbacks: 'I have forgotten to maintain mindfulness, and as a result, my mind has fallen under the power of afflictions.' One should then remember the harms or sufferings of lower rebirths that will be experienced as a result, and re-establish mindfulness within the house of the mind. \n\nThis teaching explains how to rely on mindfulness as the foundation that gives rise to vigilance, protecting the mind from the thieves of afflictions that would otherwise enter when mindfulness is not guarded.",

Through this close association with teachers who possess mindfulness and awareness, mindfulness will naturally arise in the student, which is why all vehicles of Buddhist practice emphasize the necessity of maintaining an unbroken connection with qualified teachers.\n\n**'མཁན་པོས་རྗེས་སུ་བསྟན་པ་དང་། །' (And through the preceptor's instructions)**\n\nFurthermore, the preceptor must properly instruct and guide the student in the principles of what to adopt and what to reject according to the correct way of practice. The student should then diligently practice what is taught, adopting virtuous actions and abandoning non-virtuous ones according to these instructions, whether they are engaged in hearing, contemplating, or meditating on the Dharma.\n\n**'འཇིགས་པས་སྐལ་ལྡན་གུས་བྱེད་ལ། །' (The fortunate ones who respect [the training] out of fear)**\n\nIf one transgresses the training, then out of fear or apprehension of being criticized or embarrassed by the teacher, and understanding the negative consequences of such transgressions, fortunate individuals (those with the proper karmic disposition) will develop respect for the training. This healthy sense of shame and fear of criticism serves as another cause for developing mindfulness.\n\n**'དྲན་པ་བདེ་བླག་ཉིད་དུ་སྐྱེ། །' (Mindfulness arises easily)**\n\nFor these fortunate practitioners who deeply respect the training, mindfulness that does not forget virtuous objects of meditation will arise easily and naturally.

    "<5><32> Combined Commentary:\n\nHaving thus contemplated again and again without forgetting that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, who possess unhindered vision of all objects of knowledge across all times and places, are constantly observing us, one should abide with a sense of shame (ngo tsha). This shame refers to restraint from misdeeds based on one's own reasoning and integrity.\n\nOne should also maintain respect (gus pa) for the Teacher and the Dharma, along with fear ('jigs pa) of karmic ripening and restraint from wrongdoing due to others' presence out of a sense of propriety. As stated in the Jātaka: 'Even if one commits misdeeds without being seen, how can one be happy, as if having consumed poison? It is impossible not to be seen by the pure eyes of gods and yogis.'\n\nBy abiding in this manner, not only will general mindfulness arise, but specifically, among the six recollections of bodhisattva training (recollection of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, generosity, moral discipline, and deities), the recollection of the Buddha together with the Dharma and Sangha will arise in that person again and again without effort. Thus, the remembrance of the Three Jewels develops with ease, and one becomes endowed with these qualities.",
    "<5><33> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen mindfulness is placed at the door of the mind's dwelling, remaining close by for the purpose of guarding the mind against engaging with objects of afflictions, at that time, introspective awareness (samprajanya) naturally arises in one's physical, verbal, and mental conduct. This awareness discerns and correctly understands the circumstances of what should and should not be done. And even if occasionally one forgets or awareness strays elsewhere—even when it has deteriorated and departed—it will regenerate and return again. Therefore, whether one is skilled or unskilled in practice depends on how one maintains mindfulness and clear awareness, so one should become adept at this.\n\nThis verse is part of the third section, which teaches how to train in mind training practices through mindfulness and awareness. This section has three aspects: the moral discipline of restraining from harmful actions, the moral discipline of gathering virtuous qualities, and the moral discipline of benefiting sentient beings. The first of these has two parts: purifying all actions of body, speech, and mind (the three doors), and protecting one's vows from deterioration. This particular instruction addresses examining the conduct of body and speech, specifically focusing on the preliminary application of introspective awareness.",
    "<5><34> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen engaging in any activity, one should first examine the mind carefully. 'This kind of mind' refers to whatever thoughts or motivations are arising. One must analyze whether these thoughts are virtuous or non-virtuous, afflicted or unafflicted. \n\nThe verse instructs us to recognize when 'this is flawed' - meaning when we identify that a thought or motivation contains faults, is harmful, or is afflicted by negative emotions. Having understood the faulty nature of such a mind state, we should not let it influence our actions.\n\n'At that time' refers to the moment when we detect a faulty motivation or afflicted state of mind arising. This is the crucial point where mindfulness must be applied.\n\nThe phrase 'I should remain able to hold firm like a piece of wood' indicates that we should not engage our body in action, not speak with our voice, and not allow our mind to follow after these negative thoughts. Just as a tree or piece of wood remains unmoved by the wind, we should maintain control, not allowing our mind to fall under the influence of these afflictions.\n\nThis verse forms part of a larger teaching on mental discipline that includes examining the activities of the three doors (body, speech, and mind), bringing them under control, and training in conduct that purifies the mind. The key instruction is to immediately recognize negative thoughts as soon as they arise and prevent them from influencing our behavior.",

    "<5><36> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFor the purpose of resting one's eyes and relieving fatigue when one becomes tired from focusing too intently, one should occasionally look in different directions with mindfulness and awareness. This allows one to rest both the eyes and mind without becoming distracted.\n\nIf someone appears in one's field of vision having approached where one is staying, one should not look at them with hatred or other negative emotions. Instead, one should lower one's gaze about the length of a yoke and look at them properly, perhaps with a smile.\n\nWhen someone comes into view, one should greet them pleasantly by saying, 'It is good that you have come!' or 'Welcome,' as is appropriate to local custom (such as Indians do when someone arrives). This way of speaking pleasant words helps to make others feel comfortable.\n\nAdditionally, when traveling on a path, it is advisable to repeatedly look in the four directions to check whether there are any dangers on the road or elsewhere, ensuring one's safety while maintaining mindful awareness.",
    "<5><37> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nOn roads and other places that have dangers, to investigate whether there are dangers such as enemies, one should, without letting one's mind wander, repeatedly and methodically look at the four directions—east and so forth—with a calm gaze. When looking around in this way, if someone appears in one's field of vision and approaches, one should look at them with a smile and say, 'It is good that you have come.' When traveling on a path, one should cautiously examine for dangers such as wrong turns, thieves, or wild animals, inspecting as appropriate in all four directions.\n\nOne must look repeatedly—that is, quickly—in the four directions when necessary. Especially when resting on the road or at similar times, one should not engage in wild, unruly behaviors such as quickly turning one's head or jumping about, which would appear unseemly in front of others. Instead, one should remain composed and peaceful, turning one's face around to look behind.\n\nMoreover, when setting off after having rested, one should turn one's face backward and look in the direction behind oneself to check for belongings and so forth. After examining whether there are precipices or hazards in front and behind, one should proceed or turn back in whatever way is appropriate. To avoid the harm of distraction, one should rest and look, and at that time, turn one's face around to look in the direction behind oneself.",

First, one should mentally establish the intention, 'With my body, I shall abide in this way'—which may refer to specific postures such as sitting with legs in full lotus position and hands in meditative equipoise, following the seven posture points of Vairocana, or any appropriate physical deportment for a given situation, such as when attending a village meeting or community gathering.\n\nAfter having determined this intention and restrained unnecessary physical activities ('བྱ་བ་བསྡོགས་ནས་'), one should then ('དེ་ནས་ནི།') continuously examine oneself during intervals or occasions ('སྐབས་སུ་') of activity.\n\nThe practitioner should investigate with mindfulness, 'In what manner is this body positioned?' ('ལུས་འདི་ཇི་ལྟ་བུར། ། གནས་པ་ཡིན་ཞེས་') - checking whether the body remains in the same posture as originally established or if it has shifted from one's initial intention. This requires vigilant awareness and examination ('བལྟ་བར་བྱ།').\n\nThis practice serves to develop mindfulness of the body and to strive for physical conduct free from faults. It forms part of the broader training in establishing the mind on virtuous objects of focus and examining whether one maintains single-pointedness in virtue.",

Just as a mad elephant can cause great harm if it escapes its restraints, our untamed mind, when influenced by attachment, aversion, and other afflictive emotions, can cause tremendous harm, leading to lower rebirths such as hell and hungry ghost realms.\n\n**'ཆོས་ལ་སེམས་པའི་ཀ་ཆེན་ལ། །' (To the great pillar of contemplating the Dharma)**\n\nThis wild mind must be firmly tied to the 'great pillar of contemplating the Dharma'—referring to the focused practice of studying, listening to, and meditating on the holy teachings.

    "<5><41> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nOne should strive with utmost effort to meditate on profound concentration (samādhi), directing one's mind toward virtuous objects alone. This samadhi should be diligently maintained without letting it slip away even for a single moment toward inappropriate objects. If there is any slight distraction, one should immediately examine one's mind thinking, 'Where is my mind engaged and operating apart from concentration?' One must repeatedly scrutinize one's mind, asking, 'Where is this mind of mine engaged—in virtuous or non-virtuous objects?' In this way, one must vigilantly inspect one's mind, distinguishing between what should be done and what should not be done, and then restore it to the object of meditation, keeping it undistracted and remaining in a state of equipoise. This constitutes the third point in the sequence of instructions on guarding awareness.",
    "<5><42> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen confronted with terrifying situations that threaten one's life (such as encountering tigers or leopards), during religious festivities (like offering ceremonies to the Three Jewels), or when engaged in activities that significantly benefit sentient beings, if one finds it difficult to maintain extremely disciplined conduct or single-pointed meditative concentration, one is permitted to act in whatever way is comfortable and suitable to those circumstances. The reasoning behind this teaching is explained in the Akṣayamati Sūtra, which states: 'Thus, during times of giving, moral discipline should be set aside with equanimity.' This means that although moral discipline is generally considered superior to generosity, during extensive acts of giving without restrictions, certain minor precepts of moral discipline—such as rules about excessive hand movements, giving alcohol, or even telling a falsehood by saying 'I have not seen' when one has actually seen someone who is about to be killed (in order to grant them fearlessness)—may be temporarily relaxed. This teaching demonstrates the importance of becoming skilled in the sequential nature of the path, completing it progressively while maintaining mindfulness and awareness, without allowing the mind to become distracted.",

    "<5><45> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhen various types of idle gossip, frivolous talk, and tales about kings and thieves occur, one should be cautious about engagement.

In particular, when teachers and important people observe performances by beggars and such, they should make offerings to support them rather than merely indulging in the entertainment.\n\nIf circumstances necessitate engagement with such activities, one should participate without developing attachment, maintaining awareness of their ultimately inconsequential nature.",

Then, with steadfastness, not coming under the influence of afflictive emotions, one should engage in actions that are reasonable and appropriate, knowing when to proceed and when to refrain.\n\nThe bodhisattva should act in accordance with reason and propriety, meaning one should abandon engagement in non-virtuous actions and engage only in virtuous ones. This section is part of a larger explanation that includes five parts: how to act when afflictive emotions arise; how to act in times of excitement; how to act in times of gain and honor; how to act when considering others' welfare; and how to act when anger and discouragement are about to arise.\n\nIf one can genuinely ensure that the twenty-seven subtle gateways to misconduct do not arise in one's mindstream, then violations of the three trainings—Pratimoksha, Bodhisattva, and Mantra—will not occur.

Similarly, one should not speak words about those objects that would express or strengthen these negative emotions. Instead of following after such thoughts, one should remain without activity of body, speech, and mind—staying steadfast like a piece of wood or tree.

One should maintain this determination against the influence of afflictive emotions, as previously explained.\n\nThis section is followed by teachings on how to train in the moral discipline of gathering virtuous dharmas, which has two parts: abandoning attachment to the body (which is the cause of not training in the training), and becoming skilled in the methods of practice and accomplishing virtue. The body itself has no essence worth clinging to, yet it should be used properly for the sake of virtue because it quickly perishes. As the commentaries explain, one should question why the body is to be protected, since it lacks even the power to accomplish its own purpose.",
    "<5><59> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'When vultures, attached to flesh, pull and drag the body in all directions.' This verse describes how after death, vultures and other scavengers, driven by their craving for flesh, will drag parts of the corpse in different directions, scattering the intestines and other body parts as they devour them.\n\n'Your mind does not feel displeasure toward those vultures.' At the time of death, when vultures are consuming the body, the consciousness that has departed does not feel aversion toward these animals or try to protect the now-abandoned body. The mind shows no attachment to what was once considered 'my body.'\n\n'So why now do you give advice about caring for this body?' This is a rhetorical question challenging our present attachment. If after death we won't care about this body when it's being consumed by vultures, why are we now so attached to it—feeding it, clothing it, protecting it from the slightest harm, and becoming upset when others criticize even minor aspects of it like the eyes or nose?\n\nThe verse serves as a powerful contemplation on the impermanence of the body and the irrationality of our attachment to it. Since we will eventually abandon this body and feel no connection to it, our current excessive concern and identification with it is shown to be inconsistent and ultimately not reasonable. This teaching encourages us to develop detachment from the body through antidotal thinking that counters our habitual self-cherishing.",

Similarly, when considering your body: even though you constantly nourish and maintain this physical form with food, clothing, and various necessities, ultimately it will depart elsewhere beyond your control when death comes. The body and mind will inevitably separate and go in different directions, rendering all your care ultimately futile. Therefore, the verse questions: why do you, the mind, exhaust yourself and work to the point of exhaustion nurturing this body with such great hardship and exertion?

First, when performed with temporal excellence, meaning continuously or regularly rather than occasionally. Second, when motivated by intense aspiration or strong dedication—such as deep faith or compassion. Third, when aroused by antidotes to opposing factors—for instance, practicing generosity by giving precisely what one values most serves as an antidote to miserliness, or observing ethical discipline by abandoning whatever one is most attached to, thereby countering the opposites of the six perfections. Fourth, when directed toward superior fields: fields endowed with qualities (such as the Three Jewels), fields that have benefited oneself (such as parents), or fields of suffering (such as the sick, poor, travelers from afar, or those suffering from long-term illness). \n\nAs the Letter to a Friend (bShes spring) states: 'Actions arising from continuous strong attachment, without an antidote, and directed toward objects endowed with supreme qualities—both virtuous and non-virtuous—are of five types that become great.' The same principle applies to negative actions. For virtuous acts, mere imitation by others accomplishes nothing. Particularly with bodhisattva conduct like generosity, there are distinctions between pure and impure forms. Simply giving without understanding proper motivation, methods, dedication and so forth is something even animals can do. Therefore, one must become skilled in these essential points and strive diligently in virtuous practice.",

This preparation of both knowledge and joyful attitude is essential before engaging in virtuous activities.\n\n'ལས་རྣམས་བདག་གིས་རྟག་ཏུ་བྱ། །' (I should always personally perform these activities)\nThe bodhisattva's activities—such as the six perfections—should always be performed by oneself rather than delegated to others.

One should 'always personally perform virtuous deeds' as noted in Commentary 2.\n\n'ལས་རྣམས་ཀུན་ལ་སུ་ལ་ཡང་། །' (Regarding all these activities, toward anyone)\nFor all spiritual activities such as making offerings, practicing generosity, and other virtuous deeds, one should not merely delegate responsibilities to others or wait for others' prompting.

If one can accomplish a virtuous deed oneself, one should do so without waiting for others.

These perfections require discernment in their practice, as they form a hierarchical system of spiritual development.\n\n'གོང་ནས་གོང་དུ་ཁྱད་ཞུགས་སྤྱད། །' (Practice them in progressively superior order):\nOne should practice these perfections in a successive order of increasing excellence, as each higher perfection is more distinguished than the lower ones. As stated in the Sūtrālaṅkāra: 'The latter depends on the former, and they are explained in terms of inferior and superior, coarse and subtle.' The difference between the lower and higher perfections is compared to the difference between water in a cow's hoofprint and the great ocean, with each higher perfection yielding greater benefit.\n\n'ཆུང་ངུའི་ཕྱིར་ནི་ཆེ་མི་གཏང་། །' (Do not abandon the greater for the sake of the lesser):\nAs a general rule, one should not abandon a superior virtue (like moral discipline) for the sake of an inferior one (like generosity). When faced with situations where one cannot perform both simultaneously and must choose between them, the lesser should be abandoned to preserve the greater. However, there are exceptions to this hierarchical approach.\n\n'གཙོ་ཆེར་གཞན་གྱི་དོན་བསམ་མོ། །' (Primarily consider the welfare of others):\nThe determining factor for what is greater or lesser is the benefit to others. Bodhisattvas must primarily think about and accomplish whatever brings the greatest benefit to sentient beings, even if it means temporarily setting aside the hierarchical order of the perfections.

    "<5><84> Combined Commentary\n\nHaving thus understood the proper ethical discipline—what to adopt and what to reject—one should always remain diligent for the welfare of others. This means constantly engaging with great effort in accomplishing the benefit of sentient beings, completely free from self-centered motivation.\n\nFor one who strives in this way, the Buddha, who possesses great compassion and has far-reaching vision—perceiving even remote and hidden matters directly—permits even those seven physical and verbal non-virtues that are prohibited for followers of the Lesser Vehicle (śrāvakas) who prioritize their own benefit. These actions are allowed for bodhisattvas when appropriate circumstances arise.\n\nFar from becoming faults, such actions become great accumulations of merit when done with pure motivation for others' welfare. This is illustrated in the Mahārahasya Upāyakauśalya Sūtra (Great Secret Skillful Means), which states: 'Through great compassion, the captain killed the dark man and thereby eliminated many eons of saṃsāra.' Similarly, the story of the brahmin youth Karmā (or Tāraka), who engaged in sexual misconduct to save a merchant's daughter from death, shows how such acts can complete many eons' worth of accumulations.\n\nAlternatively, 'the compassionate one who sees far' can also refer to the bodhisattva himself, for whom these otherwise prohibited actions are permitted when done solely for others' benefit.",

This sharing of food demonstrates compassion for all beings.\n\n**རན་པ་ཙམ་དུ་བཟའ་བྱ་སྟེ། །**\n\nFor oneself, one should first offer the best portion to the Three Jewels, then eat only a moderate amount—just enough to satisfy hunger without attachment or aversion—as stated in the Letter to a Friend (Suhṛllekha): 'Food should be consumed like medicine, with proper reasoning.' One should maintain balance: eating too much makes the body heavy and dull, while eating too little makes one weak and unable to accomplish virtuous deeds. As the Candrapradīpa Sūtra warns, if yogis consume food with attachment and without practicing diligently, that food becomes 'poisonous to them, like an unwashed lotus root eaten by a calf.'\n\n**ཆོས་གོས་གསུམ་མ་གཏོགས་པ་སྦྱིན། །**\n\nRegarding possessions, except for the three Dharma robes one wears—the outer robe (saṃghāṭī/namjar), the upper robe (uttarāsaṅga/lagö), and the lower robe (antarvāsa/thangö)—one should give away whatever other possessions one has. The Bodhisattva Prātimokṣa specifically states that if one has extra sets of robes beyond the basic three, those may be given away, but if one has only a single set, they should not be given away as 'they are the basis for maintaining the life of purity' and giving them would create an obstacle to pure conduct (brahmacharya).",

Rather than harming it, one should protect it as one would a wound, avoiding the two extremes in food and clothing, taking just enough to sustain oneself with a satisfied stomach and modest protection.\n\nIf one protects this body in this way, by relying on this precious human rebirth endowed with leisure and opportunity, one will be able to engage in bodhisattva conduct, dedicate virtues to perfect enlightenment, and make aspirational prayers to benefit sentient beings. By doing so, one will swiftly fulfill all the aspirations of sentient beings—both their temporary and ultimate welfare and happiness—through perfecting the three trainings.\n\nAs it is stated in the Four Hundred Verses (Catuhśataka): 'Although one should view the body as an enemy, nevertheless one should protect it. One who is endowed with moral discipline and lives long will generate great merit from it.'",

This impurity refers to a state where others are not yet valued more than oneself, and where one's motivation might be mixed with self-concern.\n\n**Line 2: 'ལུས་འདི་གཏང་བར་མི་བྱ་སྟེ། །' (One should not give away this body)**\n\nA beginner with impure motivation should not physically give away this body, which serves as the support for practicing the sublime Dharma, by giving their head, limbs, or flesh to others when requested. This is because it is uncertain whether such giving will truly benefit others, and one might experience regret, change of heart, or create obstacles to virtue. As stated in the Śikṣāsamuccaya: 'One should protect oneself like a great medicinal tree' and 'For example, although one might give the seeds suitable for preparation, such as the roots and so forth of a beautiful medicinal tree, one should protect them from being used at the wrong time.' Giving at inappropriate times is declared to be the work of Māra.\n\n**Line 3-4: 'ཅི་ནས་འདི་དང་གཞན་དུ་ཡང་། །དོན་ཆེན་སྒྲུབ་པའི་རྒྱུར་གཏང་ངོ་། །' (However, by all means, in this life and others, one should give it as a cause to accomplish great purpose)**\n\nHowever, when one is free from obstacles to generosity such as miserliness, and when giving will complete vast accumulations of merit without fault, then one should give one's body as a cause for accomplishing great benefits for both the doctrine and beings. This applies both in this life and future lives, as exemplified by the divine teacher Jangchub Ö who gave away his body. In essence, one should by all means offer oneself as a servant to others when it will serve as a cause for accomplishing great purpose, but only when one's intention is pure and one can give according to what is appropriate.",

If taught under such circumstances, the greatness of the Dharma would diminish, it would not benefit the listener, and moreover, by showing disrespect to the Dharma, they would fall into lower rebirths.\n\nEven if one's attitude is respectful, one should not teach Dharma to those who are not sick yet have their heads wrapped with turbans or other coverings. This prohibition extends to those wearing hats or who have covered their heads with cloth or other garments.\n\nSimilarly, one should not teach Dharma to those carrying umbrellas, which suggests an attitude of superiority or protection from the teaching.\n\nOne should also refrain from teaching those holding walking sticks (supports for hands) or staffs when they are not ill, as this may indicate casual or improper attention.\n\nFurthermore, one should not teach Dharma to those carrying weapons such as swords and spears, which is incompatible with the peaceful nature of the teachings.\n\nIt should be noted that these restrictions apply specifically to those who are not ill.

    "<5><94> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen someone asks for directions or when communicating with others, one should not disrespectfully gesture with the left hand or point with a single finger. Such pointing with individual fingers would be considered contemptuous and improper. Instead, with a respectful and joyful demeanor in both physical expression and speech, one should properly and thoroughly show the way using all fingers of the right hand together. The right hand should be raised upward with reverence, with all fingers extended together in a unified gesture. This should be done in such a manner that inspires faith in worldly people. One should avoid moving the hands excessively or forcefully without purpose, as this would appear frivolous and agitated. When a slight hand movement is needed, one may make a subtle sound or snap the fingers, but excessively loud sounds or unrestrained conduct would constitute improper behavior. In summary, directions should always be indicated with the entire right hand in a respectful manner.",
    "<5><95> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Do not move the hands excessively' means that when taking or placing utensils or when signaling to others, one should not move the hands too vigorously or make exaggerated gestures, as this leads to frivolous behavior and disrespect. \n\n'When moving slightly, make a sound' indicates that for minor movements or when communicating minor matters, one should accompany the movement with appropriate sounds like finger snapping to communicate awareness to others.\n\n'Using finger snaps and other signals' refers to the proper methods of signaling—such as respectfully using the right hand with all fingers extended rather than disrespectful gestures with individual fingers of the left hand.\n\n'Otherwise, one will become unrestrained' warns that if one does not follow these guidelines of mindful movement and proper signaling, one's conduct will become unrestrained, causing worldly people to lose faith. As the Śikṣāsamuccaya states: 'If that is not worthy of being upheld, one disparages the sprout of the world's Conqueror. Like fire covered with ashes, it will burn in the hell realms and so forth.' Therefore, one should strive to maintain restrained, respectful conduct in all physical movements.",

This means adopting the lion's posture: placing the right side on the ground, with the right hand beneath the cheek, and the left hand extended over the thigh.\n\nOne may lie with the head pointing in any desired direction—east, north, or otherwise—with one leg placed upon the other (the left leg on top of the right leg), and with the body well covered by the Dharma robe.\n\nWith mindfulness and clear comprehension, one should apply to the mind, from the very beginning of lying down, the thought: 'I will quickly rise for virtuous purposes,' focusing on the perception of light, the perception of death, and the intention to rise quickly.\n\nAs stated in the Ratnamegha Sūtra (Precious Cloud Sutra): 'When lying down, one lies on the right side, with one leg placed upon the other, the body covered with the dharma robe, lying down with mindfulness and clear comprehension, with the perception of rising and of light.' By doing so, even sleep becomes virtuous.\n\nIn this practice, one should coordinate one's activities throughout a single lifetime or a single day. Thus, when the sun rises in the morning, it corresponds to the time of birth; midday to the prime of life; evening to old age; lying down to being struck by the illness of death; sleep to dying; dreams to the intermediate state; and waking in the morning to taking rebirth in the next life. At each of these times, one should establish the perception that corresponds to that particular state and not forget to practice the precious bodhicitta.",

One should cultivate and engage in these mind-purifying practices for as long as one has not yet successfully trained the mind, or for as long as one is unable to implement all the more advanced practices.\n\nThis section relates to the methods for perfecting training, particularly addressing the causes that purify training when one becomes tainted by downfalls despite striving in practice. For root downfalls, as stated in the Śikṣāsamuccaya, one should confess before Noble Ākāśagarbha and restore one's vows, while for minor and middling impurities, one should follow the remedial practices specified in the texts.",

These two elements are essential components of the four powers of purification.\n\n'ལྟུང་བའི་ལྷག་མ་དེས་ཞི་བྱ།' (The remnants of downfalls will be pacified by that)\nThrough this practice, the 'remnants of downfalls'—infractions other than root downfalls, such as misdeeds and secondary violations—will be pacified or purified.

    "<5><100> Combined Commentary\n\n'There is no field of knowledge in which Bodhisattvas, the children of the Conquerors, do not train.' For Bodhisattvas, nothing whatsoever among objects of knowledge should be left unstudied—whether it be crafts, medicine, grammar, logic, inner sciences, or the five major and five minor fields of knowledge. As stated in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra: 'Without making effort in the five sciences, even the supreme noble ones cannot attain omniscience. Therefore, to refute others, to nurture them, and to gain complete knowledge oneself, one should apply effort to these sciences.'\n\n'For the wise one who abides in this way' in proper understanding and practice of these trainings, 'there is no action that does not become meritorious.' For such a wise Bodhisattva who trains in limitless fields of knowledge and abides in mindfulness and awareness, even the smallest actions—down to the lifting and placing of feet or the extending and contracting of hands—become causes for merit and virtue. If even non-virtuous actions can be transformed into virtue through their skillful means, what need is there to mention neutral actions?\n\nTherefore, one should not generate disbelief about the comprehensive training of Bodhisattvas, as this complete engagement in all forms of knowledge is precisely what enables them to fully accomplish the benefit of others. This section leads into the third part, which addresses dedicating virtues for the benefit of all sentient beings, and never abandoning the spiritual friend of the Great Vehicle and its training.",
    "<5><101> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhether directly serving others through material gifts and Dharma teachings, or indirectly through engaging in solitary retreats and practices dedicated to others through aspirations and prayers, one should exclusively work for the benefit of all sentient beings rather than pursuing self-interest or other aims. \n\nFor the sole purpose of benefiting sentient beings alone, one must dedicate all virtuous roots—whatever accomplishments in the six perfections and other virtues accumulated in the three times by oneself and others—toward attaining the state of complete enlightenment.\n\nThis teaching reflects the fourth point regarding the spiritual friend who constantly guides beings as the vehicle (thegpa), which consists of both method and wisdom. As stated in the Ornament of the Sutras (Sūtrālaṃkāra), the Great Vehicle possesses seven greatnesses: greatness of objects, two kinds of practice, wisdom, diligent effort, undertaking, skillful means, great perfect accomplishment, and the great enlightened activities of the Buddhas.\n\nOne who is skilled in the meaning of the Great Vehicle and who abides in the supreme vows—the ethical discipline of the bodhisattva—would not abandon these commitments even for the sake of one's own life. One should make such dedications and aspirations that transform all activities toward the ultimate goal of enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.",
    "<5><102> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nརྟག་པར་དགེ་བའི་བཤེས་གཉེན་ནི། (Always the virtuous spiritual friend)\nThe verse begins by emphasizing that one should always rely on the virtuous spiritual friend (kalyāṇamitra).

As stated in the Ornament of Sūtras: 'Because it possesses seven greatnesses—greatness of object, likewise the two accomplishments, wisdom, diligence in effort, skillful means, great perfect accomplishment, and great enlightened activity—it is definitively called the Great Vehicle.' The spiritual friend must be knowledgeable in all aspects of these Mahāyāna teachings.\n\nབྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་བརྟུལ་ཞུགས་མཆོག (The supreme ethical discipline/vows of bodhisattva conduct)\nThis line indicates that the spiritual friend should be one who abides in the supreme ethical discipline or vows of bodhisattva conduct.

This demonstrates the supreme importance of the teacher-student relationship on the Mahāyāna path.",
    "<5><103> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFrom the biography of the youth Śrīsaṃbhava (Śrībhūti) in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra (which is a section of the Avatamsaka Sutra), one should train in the manner of serving the guru as taught. When the bodhisattva Sudhana had served many excellent spiritual friends, over one hundred and ten, he came before the youth Śrīsaṃbhava and the maiden Śrīmati, from whose biographies we learn the proper way to serve the spiritual friend.\n\nOne should serve the guru with a mind like the earth, never wearying of bearing all burdens; like a vajra, unbreakable in determination; like a surrounding wall, undisturbed by any suffering; like a servant, never disdaining any task to be performed; like a sweeper, abandoning pride and arrogance; like a beast of burden, carrying heavy loads; like a dog, never becoming angry; like a boat, never tiring of coming and going; and with a mind like a dutiful child, always looking to the spiritual friend's countenance.\n\nFurthermore, as the sutra instructs: 'Noble son (or child), you should generate the perception of yourself as sick (a patient), the perception of the spiritual friend as a doctor (physician), the perception of the Dharma (their instructions) as medicine, and the perception of diligent practice as recovery from illness (the cure for your illness).'\n\nIn addition to what has been explained here, one should become knowledgeable about the precepts taught in this treatise and other teachings given by the Buddha by reading the Mahayana sutras. As the sutras teach the precepts extensively, one should read them to understand the bodhisattva trainings, including what to adopt and what to abandon in serving a spiritual friend. In particular, after taking the bodhisattva vow, one should first study the Noble Sutra of Akashagarbha (Space Essence).",
    "<5><104> Combined Commentary\n\nThe trainings of bodhisattvas become apparent and clearly understood by examining the various sūtras. For this reason, one should diligently read and study the Mahāyāna sūtras, as they present the trainings extensively. In particular, after taking the bodhisattva vow, one should first and foremost study the Noble Ākāśagarbha Sūtra (Space Essence Sūtra), as it clearly explains the classifications of the eighteen root downfalls of bodhisattvas along with their methods of restoration. Since understanding these downfalls and how to repair them if they occur is essential knowledge from the very beginning of one's practice, this sūtra must be examined first before proceeding to other teachings.",
    "<5><105> Combined Commentary\n\nSince the Śikṣāsamuccaya (Compendium of Training), composed by Śāntideva himself, clearly and extensively explains the practices and trainings that bodhisattvas should engage in at all times, one must definitely study this text repeatedly. This instruction is given because the text thoroughly teaches the thirty-two methods of giving away, protecting, purifying, and increasing one's body, possessions, and virtues that constitute constant bodhisattva conduct. The directive to read it 'again and again' emphasizes that this text should not be studied just once, but rather consulted repeatedly and without fail as an essential reference for anyone following the bodhisattva path.",

    "<5><108> Combined Commentary\n\n'With regard to the states of body and mind,' one should understand this includes physical actions, verbal expressions, and mental processes in all their conditions and circumstances. 'One should repeatedly examine' means not just momentarily but constantly, again and again, with the discriminating wisdom that discerns whether one's activities are virtuous, non-virtuous, or neutral. This examination involves investigating whether one is contradicting or upholding one's ethical trainings, and whether one has fallen under the influence of afflictive emotions. 'This alone, in brief' indicates that this continual self-monitoring is the essential point being conveyed. 'Is the characteristic of guarding introspective awareness' means maintaining vigilant awareness without deterioration, with enthusiasm for adopting what is beneficial and rejecting what is harmful. This defines the proper practice of mindfulness that protects one's awareness from wandering into unskillful states. In essence, this verse describes the fundamental practice of maintaining constant vigilance over all aspects of one's being.",
    "<5><109> Combined Commentary\n\nOne should diligently practice these instructions with the body, meaning through actual application of practice, not merely through verbal recitation. What purpose or benefit can be accomplished by merely reciting or explaining the words of the text? Nothing whatsoever will be accomplished, so one must strive to put the meaning into practice. For example, just as reading or explaining medical treatises such as the Four Tantras without actually taking medicine will not benefit sick patients or their illnesses—the patients must physically consume the medicine and follow prescribed behaviors. Similarly, in spiritual practice, if one lacks the two eyes of mindfulness and awareness, even though one possesses learning and physical strength, one cannot cross over the vast expanse of samsara.\n\nIn brief, although there are three types of moral discipline, it is primarily important to first train in the discipline of restraint—the direct precepts of individual liberation (pratimokṣa). It is a great error to think, 'The pratimokṣa vows belong to the Śrāvaka tradition,' and then to seek the bodhisattva precepts elsewhere. The discipline of restraint serves as the foundation for both accumulating virtuous dharmas and benefiting sentient beings. Therefore, those who possess wisdom should cherish mindfulness and awareness as precious.\n\nThis is from the fifth chapter on 'Guarding Introspective Awareness' in 'Entering the Bodhisattva's Way of Life.'",
    "<5><110> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThese training precepts for body, speech, and mind that have been explained must be practiced and trained in diligently and directly. What purpose or benefit can be accomplished merely by reciting or explaining the words of the text? Since nothing will be accomplished, one must strive to put the meaning into practice.\n\nFor example, can merely reading or explaining medical treatises like the Four Tantras, without taking the medicine, benefit the sick? It will not. Just as benefits come from actually consuming medicine with the body and properly following practices such as correct lifestyle, and so forth.\n\nIn brief, although there are three types of ethical discipline, it is first most important to train in the discipline of vows, either directly in the Prātimokṣa precepts or in those common to it. If one upholds these vows, the others will be upheld as well; if one fails to uphold these, the others will not be upheld either. As stated in the Compendium (Saṃgrahavāstu): 'When the discipline of vows degenerates, all vows degenerate.'\n\nThose who mistakenly think, 'The Prātimokṣa vows belong to the Śrāvakas,' and claim to seek bodhisattva precepts elsewhere commit a grave error of misunderstanding. The discipline of vows—such as avoiding naturally unwholesome actions—forms the foundation for both accumulating virtuous qualities and benefiting sentient beings.\n\nOne should train in ethical discipline while repeatedly cultivating the determination to restrain from factors contrary to moral conduct. Furthermore, one should practice this with the six perfections, making practice the essence of the path. Those who follow the path of the three types of persons must rely on guarding mindfulness and awareness; thus, one should always be skilled in their methods.\n\nThis is the fifth chapter from the Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, entitled 'Guarding Introspective Awareness.'"

    "<6><1> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nThe verse speaks of virtuous deeds accumulated over a thousand great kalpas. A 'kalpa' refers to the four cycles of formation, existence, destruction, and void, with each containing twenty intermediate kalpas—thus eighty intermediate kalpas constitute one great kalpa. The accumulated virtues include generosity (dāna) toward sentient beings, making offerings to the Sugatas (the Buddhas), taking refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha), and other virtues such as maintaining moral discipline.\n\nAll these wholesome deeds, whatever they may be, can be destroyed by a single instance of intense anger. This is confirmed in the Mañjuśrīvikrīḍita Sūtra: 'Mañjuśrī, what is called anger destroys virtuous deeds accumulated over a hundred kalpas.' Different teachings mention that anger destroys accumulations of both a hundred and a thousand kalpas.\n\nAccording to the Madhyamakāvatāra commentary: 'If one becomes angry at ordinary beings, it destroys merits of a hundred kalpas; if at bodhisattvas, a thousand kalpas.' The Śikṣāsamuccaya further states: 'If a monk, with a devoted mind, prostrates to a stūpa containing the hair and nail relics of the Tathāgata, the merit gained would be equivalent to obtaining the universal monarch status a thousand times over for each particle of dust from where his body touches down to the golden wheel of the earth. Yet this merit is destroyed by causing harm to one's spiritual companion.'\n\nSome commentators question: 'If a single moment of anger destroys virtuous accumulations gathered through generosity over a thousand kalpas, and since ordinary beings inevitably experience anger, how could anyone attain liberation?' To address this, three distinctions are explained:\n\n1. What is destroyed: There are three types of virtue—merit-producing virtues not embraced by wisdom and skillful means, liberation-oriented virtues embraced by the realization of selflessness, and Mahāyāna virtues embraced by both wisdom and skillful means. It is primarily the first type that is destroyed.\n\n2. What destroys: It is intense anger directed at special objects (particularly bodhisattvas), without subsequent regret or counteragents.\n\n3. How destruction occurs: It does not eradicate the seed of virtue completely but suppresses its power to ripen in this life, causing it to ripen in future lives. This is because heavier karma ripens first, as stated: 'Among karmas, whichever is heavier, closer, more habitual, or done earlier will ripen first.'\n\nAdditionally, it appears that anger can destroy physical and verbal virtues of generosity and discipline, but cannot destroy mental virtues such as those arising from meditation on patience, diligence, concentration, and wisdom—due to their superior nature, with patience being directly opposed to anger itself. Moreover, virtuous roots embraced by the three excellences cannot be taken away under any circumstance.\n\nTherefore, one should diligently protect against anger and similar afflictions, as they are the ultimate obstacles to the arising and sustaining of virtuous qualities.",
    "<6><2> Combined Commentary:\n\nThere is no sin like hatred or anger, which destroys the virtues in one's own mindstream, creates obstacles to developing the path, and serves as a cause for rebirth in hell realms. And there is no virtue or austerity superior to patience, which acts as its antidote and conquers the burning torment of afflictions. As stated in the sutra: 'Patience is the supreme austerity, patience is the highest; nirvana is supreme—thus proclaimed the Buddha.' For this reason, one must diligently strive to cultivate patience with concentrated effort, employing various methods and skillful means that will be explained later. One should exert oneself in this meditation through diverse approaches, as patience is essential for both physical and mental well-being and for maintaining harmonious relationships with others.",
    "<6><3> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf one harbors in one's mind the thorn of hatred toward enemies and other adversaries, the mind will not experience perfect tranquility or the pacification of suffering. When hatred is present, meditative concentration and other spiritual qualities cannot arise in one's mind, and one cannot maintain the neutral sensation of equanimity. One will not attain mental joy or happiness, nor will one experience physical pleasure or well-being associated with the five sense faculties. Furthermore, when consumed by hatred, one will not even be able to sleep at night, as the agitated mind prevents rest. Finally, due to the instability of both body and mind caused by hatred, one becomes unsteady and unable to sustain control over oneself, losing the stability of a well-settled mind.",

If those who are indebted behave this way, others who have not received such kindness will certainly act similarly or worse. This demonstrates why one should strive to abandon anger, as it causes even friends to become enemies despite one's generosity toward them.",

    "<6><6> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn brief, there is absolutely no one who dwells happily due to anger. 'The enemy of anger' refers to how anger destroys virtuous roots and becomes one's greatest adversary, causing the previously explained disadvantages and various sufferings in this life and future lives. Through these and similar means, anger brings about manifold sufferings—it becomes the most extreme cause of one's problems both in this life and in future rebirths.\n\nThe second part of the verse states: 'Whoever exerts effort to overcome anger will be happy both here and hereafter.' This means that any person who, disciplining their mind with diligence, overcomes this enemy of anger by cultivating patience will—contrary to the disadvantages explained above—attain extensive happiness and joy in this life and in future rebirths. Since patience is exclusively a cause of happiness, one should strive to abandon anger.\n\nThis section has two main parts: contemplating the faults of anger that should be abandoned, and understanding the benefits of patience. If one does not abandon anger, as explained in the Mañjuśrī-vikrīḍita Sūtra, the disadvantages are extremely great, while overcoming anger through diligent practice brings about happiness in both this life and beyond.",

As the verse indicates, becoming unhappy about difficult situations will not accomplish what I desire.\n\nFurthermore, the virtues in my mindstream—the virtuous actions that produce desired results—will be destroyed and diminished. My virtuous qualities will deteriorate, thus giving rise to all forms of suffering. Therefore, maintaining a joyful mind is essential for both preserving virtue and preventing further suffering.",

If there is a remedy for the harm or difficulty (like for a stomach issue, as Commentary 1 notes), meaning if both oneself and others can fix it, then what purpose is there in feeling displeasure or anger toward it? Since the mental discomfort will immediately disappear when remedied (as Commentary 2 explains), there is no reason to be displeased or unhappy.\n\n'གལ་ཏེ་བཅོས་སུ་མེད་ན་ནི། །དེ་ལ་མི་དགའ་བྱས་ཅི་ཕན། །' - This verse addresses situations where no remedy exists. If there is no remedy available (like in the case of a broken white porcelain cup, as Commentary 1 mentions), since it cannot be fixed, what benefit is there in feeling displeasure about it? Not only is there no benefit, but as Commentary 1 points out, it will further harm both oneself and others with the suffering of discord. It is like being displeased with empty space devoid of obstructions—it serves no purpose (as Commentary 2 explains).\n\nThis passage relates to cultivating patience, which has several aspects. As Commentary 1 and 2 elaborate, the text will proceed to identify the objects of patience and explain how to cultivate patience itself. Commentary 1 mentions there are twenty-four objects of patience, consisting of twelve instances of undesired actions done to oneself and twelve instances of obstacles to what one desires. Commentary 2 notes that the following section will have three parts: a general explanation of the divisions of objects that give rise to anger, refutation of anger toward those who cause unwanted things, and refutation of anger toward those who create obstacles to what is desired.",

This stark difference between reactions demonstrates that our responses arise not from external objects having greater or lesser power, nor from physical differences in bodily strength, but rather from mental steadfastness or cowardice. If some people cannot even handle seeing another's blood, how much more difficult would it be for them to endure seeing their own?

Brave individuals experience increased courage when wounded and seeing their own blood, while cowardly ones may faint even at the sight of others' blood. This contrast arises respectively from the firmness of mind (citta)—having great courage and steadfastness—and from timidity or cowardice—the lack of mental steadfastness. These qualities develop through habituation and mental training.\n\n'དེ་བས་གནོད་པ་ཁྱད་བསད་ཅིང་། །སྡུག་བསྔལ་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་མི་ཚུགས་བྱོས། །' \n(Therefore, disregard harm and remain unaffected by sufferings.)\n\nTherefore, for the sake of accomplishing great purposes on the Mahāyāna path, you should make your mind steadfast and treat all harms—whether great or small—with complete indifference.

This mental shift eliminates the ego's inflation that often clouds our judgment.\n\nDue to experiencing one's own suffering, one naturally develops immeasurable compassion for others trapped in samsara who are similarly suffering, giving rise to the heartfelt wish: 'If only they could be free from this suffering.' This compassionate response connects us to the shared human experience.\n\nSeeing clearly that suffering results from negative actions, one becomes cautious of and deliberately avoids non-virtuous deeds, which are the causes of suffering. This discernment leads to greater ethical awareness in daily life.\n\nSince one naturally desires happiness rather than suffering, and recognizing that happiness results from virtue, one develops genuine joy and enthusiasm for virtuous actions, becoming meticulous about the cause-and-effect relationship between actions and their results.

It is not reasonable to be angry at them.\n\nIf one objects, saying 'I do not get angry at bile and so forth because they arise involuntarily due to conditions,' then it follows that it would be inappropriate to get angry at persons as well, because all those persons afflicted by mental disturbances are also impelled by the conditions of their afflictions, thus they have no control over themselves.\n\nBoth enemies who harm others and illnesses are all impelled by conditions—in the first case by afflictions such as anger, and in the second by factors like time, spirits, diet, and behavior—and thus lack self-control. For example, just as an illness arises due to complete conditions despite one's unwillingness, likewise, even though the person does not wish it, anger too inevitably arises due to causes such as mental distress and so forth.\n\nBeing under the power of other factors, they are dependent origination, and being dependent origination, they are emptiness. Understanding that there is neither an object of anger nor one who angers, one must overcome anger. Therefore, if one is to be angry, it is reasonable to be angry at the mental afflictions, but not at the person.",
    "<6><23> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse compares the arising of afflictions to the arising of illness. Just as various diseases such as wind, bile, and phlegm arise involuntarily—even when unwanted—due to the influence of causes and conditions, similarly, afflictive emotions like anger also arise forcefully without our control. Those who harm us, such as enemies, lack self-control because they are impelled by their afflictive emotions. Even though unwanted, these afflictions arise forcefully due to causes and conditions such as mental distress or discomfort. Therefore, both illness and afflictive emotions are similar in their lack of self-control and their dependence on conditions. This suggests that it is appropriate to be angry at the afflictive emotions themselves, but not at the person who is overcome by them. Regarding a potential objection that this comparison isn't valid because 'diseases have no intention to harm whereas enemies do have such intention,' this will be addressed in the following verse.",

This is similar to how a reflection appears in a mirror without the mirror intending to create an image.\n\n**'Similarly, even though conditions do not think 'I will generate anger,' anger arises in just the same way.'**\n\nThe conditions that trigger anger have no intention of producing such emotions, yet they inevitably give rise to anger when present. Just as a reflected object does not think 'I shall produce a reflection in the mirror,' yet its image appears due to conditions, anger manifests naturally when its causes come together. Neither the person nor the triggering conditions deliberately intend for anger to arise, yet it emerges nonetheless.\n\nThis verse demonstrates both the lack of self-control we have over our emotional responses and the lack of intention behind this process. Both illness and enemies function through this same mechanism of dependent arising - they emerge from conditions without deliberate intention.",

'Various types of misdeeds' indicates the different wrongdoings motivated by these afflictions, such as killing, stealing, and so forth. All of these faults and misdeeds 'arise from the power of conditions' - they come into being due to causes and conditions rather than appearing independently. 'They do not exist under their own control' means these negative states and actions have no independent existence or autonomy - they are dependent on circumstances and conditioning factors. Therefore, just as it would be unreasonable to become angry at water flowing downward (which is simply following its nature based on conditions), it is inappropriate to be angry at those who harm us, as their actions arise from conditions beyond their control. Instead, understanding this dependent nature of faults and misdeeds should lead us to prevent anger and generate compassion.",
    "<6><26> Combined Commentary of the Source Text\n\nThe verse is explaining that even the collection of causes and conditions that come together to produce effects (such as suffering or afflictive emotions) do not possess any intentional agency.\n\n'Those various causes that come together...' - This refers to the collection of causes like negative mental states, the three factors (object, sense faculty, and consciousness), and other conditions that generate effects such as anger or suffering. These causes and conditions must come together for effects to arise, just as visual forms and sense faculties must combine for seeing to occur.\n\n'...do not think, 'I shall produce [effects].'' - These assembled causes have no conscious intention or deliberation about producing their effects. They don't think, 'We must produce this anger (or suffering) in this person's mental continuum.' This refutes the notion that causes have agency or intention behind their causal function.\n\n'And likewise, that which is produced by them...' - The effects that arise from these causes, such as the suffering or the anger generated when the conditions come together.\n\n'...does not think, 'I was produced by these [causes].'' - The resultant effect has no consciousness of its own production, no self-awareness of being created by specific causes. The suffering produced doesn't think, 'I am produced by these conditions.'\n\nThis verse serves to refute independent agency in both causes and effects, directly challenging the Sāṃkhya view of an independent primal nature (pradhāna) and the Naiyāyika concept of a permanent self. Since neither causes nor their effects possess intentional agency, it is unreasonable to generate anger based on the assumption that others intended to cause harm. All phenomena arise through the coming together of causes and conditions without independent agency, like magical illusions.",

    "<6><28> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**'If these entities were non-arisen, then that would not exist.'**\n\nThis verse refutes the positions of the Sāṃkhyas who assert the existence of the Prime Principle (pradhāna) with its three qualities (rajas, tamas, sattva), and the Naiyāyikas who posit a permanent self. If these entities were non-arisen, then the principal (pradhāna) and self would become non-existent. The Prime Principle itself has not arisen, and without itself having arisen, the production of effects is impossible.\n\n**'In that case, who would desire to be born?'**\n\nWhen that very self does not exist without being born, then who would desire it to be born as a harmful agent and so forth? This is a rhetorical question implying there is no one, because such a self does not exist. The Sāṃkhyas claim the conscious self (puruṣa) experiences objects presented by the principal, while the Naiyāyikas assert the self as having form and being a permanent entity that produces harm and other effects. Both positions are untenable because neither the self nor the Prime Principle deliberately arises for the purpose of independently experiencing objects or producing transformations.\n\n**'By always being distracted toward objects,'**\n\nIf the self cognizes and apprehends an object like sound, it would constantly fixate on or be preoccupied with only that single object. The self is accepted as a permanent entity that experiences objects, and since it is always engaged with objects, there is no time when it does not apprehend them. Subject to the self: it follows that the apprehension of one object, such as an enemy, would never cease because it is permanently engaged with or apprehending that single object.\n\n**'It would never cease to exist.'**\n\nThe conscious self cannot cease at a time when it does not experience objects because it is accepted as permanent. It would never cease from apprehending only one object because the apprehender is permanent. The particle 'even' (yang) in the Tibetan indicates that the self would also never engage with new objects because of its permanence. Being unable to perform actions due to this permanence, such entities are equivalent to a rabbit's horn—completely non-existent.",

A permanent entity by its very nature cannot engage in any actions that produce results, as activity necessarily implies change, which contradicts permanence.\n\n**རྐྱེན་རྣམས་གཞན་དང་ཕྲད་ན་ཡང་། །འགྱུར་བ་མེད་ལ་ཅི་བྱར་ཡོད། །**\n\nEven if one argues that although the self is permanent in its nature, it could still perform functions when it comes into contact with impermanent conditions such as consciousness or effort, this position is untenable. For even when such a permanent self encounters various conditions, since it is unchanging in its essential nature, what difference could these conditions possibly make to it? It follows that conditions could do absolutely nothing to affect it. This is because something that is truly permanent cannot transcend its previous nature - the self would remain exactly as it was before encountering the conditions. If the self does not change in any way, then what exactly has the beneficial condition done to that self? It follows that the conditions would make no difference whatsoever. There can be no previously non-existent particularity produced in something permanent, for this is logically impossible.",
    "<6><30> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བྱེད་པའི་ཚེ་ཡང་སྔོན་བཞིན་ན། །' (Even at the time of action, if it remains as before)\nThis verse is addressing the logical problem of a permanent self encountering causes and conditions. It explains that when consciousness and other conditions are supposedly serving as beneficial causes, if the self remains unchanged and exactly as it was before, then it retains its original nature without any alteration.\n\n'བྱེད་པས་དེ་ལ་ཅི་ཞིག་བྱས། །' (What has the action done to it?)\nThis verse questions what specific modification or change could possibly be produced in a permanent self by any causal action or condition. The commentaries clarify that if the self is truly permanent and unchanging, then no action could actually affect it in any way—nothing would be established as having been done to it. And if it were affected, this would contradict its supposed permanence.\n\n'དེ་ཡི་བྱེད་པ་འདི་ཡིན་ཞེས། །' (Saying 'this is its action')\nThis verse challenges the claim that there could be some kind of action or benefit provided to the permanent self as a separate entity. The commentaries explain that when one says 'this is the activity producing an effect for that self' or 'this is the agent that benefits that self,' one is claiming a relationship that cannot logically exist.\n\n'འབྲེལ་པར་འགྱུར་བ་གང་ཞིག་ཡོད། །' (What connection could possibly exist?)\nThe final verse concludes by questioning what relationship could possibly exist between a permanent, unchanging self and any causal action. The commentaries elaborate that there can be no logical connection—neither identity nor causal relationship—between them, since a permanent entity by definition cannot be affected, modified, or benefited by conditions. This verse exposes the contradiction in claiming that a permanent self could participate in any relationship of mutual benefit, where one is the beneficiary and one is the benefactor.",
    "<6><31> Combined Commentary\n\nThus, all harmful agents such as enemies lack self-determination and arise due to the power of other conditions. These conditions themselves also lack independence, with earlier conditions causing later ones—for example, an enemy is controlled by anger, that anger is controlled by circumstances, and those circumstances arise from previous karmic conditions, continuing in a sequence that has no ultimate beginning. Therefore, no inherently independent thing exists, which demonstrates the principle of dependent origination and emptiness. Since all activities that produce results are under the control of other factors, and those conditions also arise due to the influence of previous causes, they have no control over whether the result arises or not. Having understood that all phenomena, while appearing, lack true existence like magical illusions, emanations, or dreams, one will not become angry at any phenomenon. Since both the object of anger and the one who becomes angry lack inherent existence, being merely dependent originations, one should train in the realization of dependent origination as lacking inherent nature, which destroys the seeds of afflictions and prevents anger from arising.",

The objector questions who (what agent) would eliminate which anger, since in emptiness there seems to be no basis for action and agent. This misconception comes from those who mistakenly consider the two truths contradictory and cannot understand how action and agent can be established within emptiness.\n\n**བཟློག་པའང་རིགས་པ་མིན་ཞེ་ན། །**\nThe objection continues: 'Since there is no agent and action, it is not reasonable that patience would counteract anger.' In other words, if everything lacks inherent existence, then the elimination of anger would also not be reasonable, since both the eliminator and what's being eliminated would be empty.\n\n**དེ་ལ་བརྟེན་ནས་སྡུག་བསྔལ་རྣམས། །**\nIn response, Shantideva explains that by relying on the antidotes (like patience) that are empty of inherent existence, the sufferings that depend on anger can cease. This is explained by Devaśarman and in the Vyākhyā. The Great Commentary notes this addresses the objection that 'if everything arises from conditions, then it would not be reasonable to eliminate anger.'\n\n**རྒྱུན་ཆད་འགྱུར་འདོད་མི་རིགས་མེད། །**\nAlthough ultimately there is no true existence, on the conventional level of mere designation, there is nothing unreasonable about accepting that the fruits of anger—the sufferings of hell realms and so forth—will cease when anger is eliminated. In fact, by realizing that both antidotes and objects of abandonment are empty of inherent existence, all afflictions like anger are exhausted, and through their exhaustion, all sufferings are brought to an end.",
    "<6><33> Combined Commentary:\n\nTherefore, whether one sees an enemy or a friend engaging in improper or harmful actions, one should reflect: 'This person has no control over themselves; they are acting this way due to such conditions and afflictive emotions, without free will.' Since everything is merely dependent arising based on other factors, one should understand that their improper behavior is not truly under their control but arises from conditions. Contemplating in this way, one should remain balanced and not become disturbed internally. Instead of becoming angry, one should maintain mental well-being and ease—that is, abide with an undisturbed mind and practice patience. This teaching also relates to the story of the Śrāvaka Elephant (Hastin) who was preparing to go out for alms, illustrating how to maintain equanimity when confronted with others' harmful actions.",
    "<6><34> Combined Commentary\n\n'If things were accomplished by mere will, independent of conditions—' This verse begins by presenting a hypothetical scenario where results could be accomplished through mere desire and independent will, without depending on conditions or causes.\n\n'then since no being desires suffering' Since no sentient being, not even a single one, desires suffering or mental unhappiness for themselves even in the slightest measure (as all beings naturally wish for happiness),\n\n'all embodied beings' Here, 'embodied beings' refers to all types of sentient beings with physical forms.\n\n'would not experience any suffering whatsoever.' No one would experience even the minutest suffering if wishes alone determined our reality. However, as we observe that suffering does indeed occur, this proves that individuals lack self-determination and that results depend on conditions rather than mere wishes.\n\nThis verse belongs to the section on cultivating patient acceptance toward those who harm us without resentment, specifically within the subsection explaining why it is reasonable to regard those who harm us as objects of compassion rather than anger. The logic establishes that beings who harm others do not have complete control over their actions but are driven by conditions (particularly ignorance and afflictions), making them worthy of compassion rather than our anger or resentment.",
    "<6><35> Combined Commentary\n\nDue to heedlessness (pramāda) and carelessness, people under the influence of afflictive emotions harm even themselves by their own actions. They inflict harm upon their own bodies with thorns and other such painful things.\n\nSome individuals, out of desire to obtain objects like women, wealth, and material possessions, become passionate, attached, and agitated toward these desired objects. In pursuit of these worldly goals, they impose suffering and great hardship upon themselves through practices such as fasting (cutting off food and drink) and similar austerities.\n\nOthers, supposedly for the sake of liberation, might inflict self-harm by walking on thorns, jumping into abysses, and engaging in various forms of self-mortification. All these examples demonstrate how, when lacking self-control, people become their own worst enemies through their misguided actions motivated by attachment and desire.",

    "<6><37> Combined Commentary:\n\nWhen people are under the control of afflictions like anger and attachment, having fallen completely under their influence and having lost all self-control as explained above, they even go so far as to kill or harm themselves—the very object of their own affection, the self that is dear and precious to their heart. At such times, when these individuals are so overwhelmed by mental afflictions that they would harm their own cherished and beloved selves, how could these same people possibly refrain from harming the bodies of other sentient beings? They will certainly cause harm to others. Having understood that this harmful behavior stems from being under the control of afflictions rather than from rational choice, it becomes unreasonable to feel anger toward such people. This is the third point in understanding why anger is inappropriate.",
    "<6><38> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen people are afflicted (kliṣṭa) by anger and other mental defilements (kleśa), they become like those possessed by demons, without self-control. In this way, when they engage in harmful activities such as hurting themselves or others including myself, they are acting under the influence of these afflictions. If I were a bodhisattva, it would be appropriate for me to generate compassion toward them, seeing how they are driven by forces beyond their control. However, if not only do I fail to generate any compassion whatsoever in my mind toward them, but instead I actually become angry at them—what can be said about this? What reason is there to become angry with them? To become angry is extremely inappropriate.\n\nThis verse begins the section examining the nature of the harm-doer, specifically examining their essence. The teaching emphasizes that even if in a hundred cases such compassion has not naturally arisen in me, it is still completely inappropriate to respond with anger toward those who harm themselves or others while under the influence of afflictive emotions. Rather than anger, compassion is the appropriate response to those who have lost control due to their mental afflictions.",
    "<6><39> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf harming and causing injury to other sentient beings is the natural disposition or inherent nature of immature, childish beings, then it is not reasonable or appropriate for me to be angry at them. These 'childish beings' refers to ordinary people who either do not understand what to accept and reject, or who understand but are overwhelmed by their afflictions. The verse compares this situation to how it would be unreasonable to harbor resentment or hold a grudge against fire when one touches it and gets burned, as it is simply in the intrinsic nature of fire to burn. Just as we wouldn't be angry at fire for acting according to its nature, similarly we shouldn't be angry at those whose nature leads them to harmful actions.",

Their fundamental nature is peaceful and kind, not harmful.\n\n'འོ་ནའང་ཁྲོ་བ་མི་རིགས་ཏེ། །' - Despite understanding the first two points, this third line asserts that becoming angry at those who harm us is still not reasonable or appropriate. This addresses the objection that anger is justified when others harm us.\n\n'མཁའ་ལ་དུད་འཐུལ་དཀོན་པ་བཞིན། །' - The final line provides a powerful metaphor: becoming angry at sentient beings for their temporary harmful actions is like becoming resentful toward the sky when smoke billows and pollutes it. Just as it would be illogical to blame empty space for the smoke that temporarily appears within it, it is unreasonable to blame beings for temporary negativities that arise due to conditions.",
    "<6><41> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse discusses the appropriate target of anger when one is harmed. When an enemy employs physical objects such as sticks, stones, swords, or weapons to inflict harm on your body, one might initially react with anger. However, the verse invites deeper contemplation on where that anger should be directed.\n\nIf one gets angry at the stick or weapon itself—the direct physical cause of harm—this would be unreasonable since these objects have no agency of their own. If instead one becomes angry at the person who throws or uses these objects (the thrower), we must recognize that even that person is driven by hatred and lacks self-control. The thrower is controlled by their own anger, acting without proper reasoning or restraint.\n\nTherefore, since the objects themselves are merely instruments and the person wielding them is compelled by anger, it is more reasonable to be angry at anger itself—the actual root cause of harm. Anger is what drives the entire sequence of events leading to harm.\n\nThis analysis is part of a larger teaching that includes several aspects: reflecting that harm inflicted by others is due to one's own faults, understanding that suffering is a consequence of having taken a physical body, recognizing that suffering results from craving the causes of suffering in previous lives, acknowledging that one's own karma has led others to become causes of suffering, and ultimately recognizing that anger itself is mistaken and inappropriate as a response.",

    "<6><43> Combined Commentary:\n\nBoth the weapon of that opponent and my own body are equally causes of suffering. When examining the situation closely, we see that suffering arises from two factors working together: the enemy's weapon and my own physical form as the object that experiences harm. If that person draws their weapon and I present my body (or my body is in a position to be harmed), and together these two elements produce my suffering, then at whom should I justifiably direct anger? Since both factors—the weapon and my body—share equal responsibility in creating this painful experience, it is not reasonable to be angry at the other person alone. The fault is equivalent on both sides, making anger specifically toward the enemy illogical and inappropriate. This reasoning demonstrates another way in which anger lacks justification.",

When we cultivate patience toward these harmful individuals, 'many of my negative actions will be purified' and we accumulate vast merit. This shows that by practicing patience in response to harm, our negativities are greatly eliminated.\n\nThe phrase 'through cultivating patience' indicates that enemies actually benefit us spiritually by providing opportunities to develop this virtue. In contrast, 'based on their harming me,' these individuals create negative karma for themselves.\n\n'These enemies will go and be reborn in the hell realms' means that due to their harmful actions toward us, they accumulate negative karma that leads to rebirth in hell realms. As stated elsewhere, 'Even by a single negative action committed in an instant, they will remain in the Avīci hell for eons.'\n\n'Experiencing extremely great suffering for a very long time' emphasizes that these individuals 'will fall into the hells of prolonged suffering' as a result of their harmful actions. This creates an ironic situation where the person being harmed actually benefits spiritually, while the harmer suffers negative consequences.\n\nThis passage refutes the objection that others cannot be benefactors to oneself, showing instead that enemies inadvertently help us by creating conditions for spiritual growth through patience, while we unintentionally harm them by being the object of their negative actions.",

It is improper to do so.\n\nFurthermore, by taking these individuals as the focus for cultivating patience, my negative karma will be exhausted, while if I respond with anger, because of me, these individuals might fall into hell where they will experience suffering for a long time. Since I am the one harming those enemies, and they are the ones benefiting me, then why, perverse and evil mind, do you become angry at those who benefit you? It would be more appropriate to rejoice in their presence.\n\nIf one objects, 'But by others creating the conditions for negative actions, I too will go to hell,' we must consider that my enemies are those who bring benefit to me by providing opportunities to practice patience.

If one thinks, 'If I am a bodhisattva, it is improper for me not to protect those who cause harm,' the response is that for now, I am unable to properly protect them.

This line indicates that if others' displeasure doesn't result in actual harm to oneself either now or in the future, then there's no substantial danger.\n\n'བདག་ནི་ཅི་ཕྱིར་དེ་མི་འདོད། །' (Why should I not want that?)\nThis final line presents the logical conclusion: if others' displeasure causes no actual harm, why should one object to it? The commentaries suggest that one should actually accept others' displeasure in such circumstances, as there is no reasonable purpose in becoming upset about something that causes no harm. It is unreasonable to dislike others or to be angry about their displeasure when it brings no tangible negative consequences.\n\nThe commentaries further place this verse within larger structural contexts, indicating it belongs to sections dealing with topics such as the sin of anger, the insubstantiality of gain, or refutation of pursuing wrong kinds of gain—suggesting this verse serves as a rational argument against reacting with aversion to others' displeasure.",
    "<6><55> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Since others cause obstruction to one's gains through contempt, derision, and so forth, creating obstacles to gain,' this refers to when someone shows disrespect toward you, causing others to lose faith in you and thereby reducing your material acquisitions.\n\n'If I dislike this,' means if one thinks, 'I dislike this disrespect and therefore I am angry,' one should consider what follows.\n\n'I will discard my gains here,' reminds us that even if we successfully obtain excellent gains such as tea, horses, gold, silver, and other possessions, when we die, we will have to abandon or discard all these possessions in this world. They will not follow us into the next life; we will depart naked, empty-handed, with arms tucked in.\n\n'But the sins will firmly remain,' means that while material gains are temporary and must be left behind at death, the sin of becoming angry for the sake of gain will definitely remain firmly established in one's mindstream. The negativities accumulated by becoming angry for the sake of those offerings will persist until their effects have been experienced, and one will inevitably have to experience the consequences without them being wasted.\n\nTherefore, even if one fails to obtain material gains, it is better to accept this than to become angry, which is inappropriate and creates long-term negative consequences that far outweigh any temporary material benefits.",
    "<6><56> Combined Commentary\n\n'I would even prefer to die today, rather than to live long with wrong livelihood. For me, even if I were to live for a long time, the suffering of death would still be the same.'\n\nThe verse clearly states that between dying today and living a long life with wrong livelihood, dying today is preferable. This is because living through wrong means is spiritually harmful, regardless of how long one lives. Wrong livelihood, as explained in the sutras, includes any attachment to the objects of the six sense faculties. The Ratnavali condenses these into five types: flattery, pretense, seeking gain through gain, giving to receive, and indirect solicitation.\n\nIf one thinks, 'I desire this life as a living being, so it's better not to die today,' one should consider that whether for oneself or anyone else, even if one remains alive for many years without dying, there's ultimately no escaping death's suffering; it must be experienced. Therefore, it's better to die today with virtue than to live long through wrong means. For those accumulating negative actions, a longer life may actually lead to greater suffering at death, making an earlier death preferable.\n\nEven if I were to die today without possessions, this would be better than living for a long time obtaining gains through harming others or through anger. For even if someone like myself were to live for a long time, ultimately I would have to abandon everything and would not escape from that very suffering of death. Moreover, after dying, I would experience additional suffering as the direct result of my wrong livelihood.",
    "<6><57> Combined Commentary Explanation of the Source Text\n\nFor example, someone who dreamt of experiencing pleasures of the five sense objects for a hundred years in a dream and then woke up, and another person who dreamt of experiencing pleasures of the five sense objects for just a moment or an instant in a dream and then awakened. When both have awakened, the happiness experienced in the dream does not return for either of them. Similarly, whether one has enjoyed happiness for a long life or a short life, at the time of death, both become merely objects of memory. Just as the happiness experienced in dreams doesn't persist after waking, the happiness experienced during life doesn't return after death. Since that is all there is to it, it is not appropriate to crave for possessions and pleasures that are as ephemeral as dream experiences.",
    "<6><58> Combined Commentary\n\nFor both those who have awakened from sleep, that happiness does not return. This verse illustrates how someone who dreams of experiencing happiness for a hundred years and then awakens, and another who dreams of experiencing happiness for just a moment and then awakens—when they have awakened, for both of them, that dream happiness is gone and does not return.\n\nSimilarly, both those who live long and those who live short, at the time of death, it is just like this. Whether one lives a long life enjoying sense pleasures for an extended period or lives a short life without much opportunity to enjoy pleasures, at the moment of death, they are equal. The happiness they previously experienced becomes merely an object of memory and will not return.\n\nBoth those who experienced pleasure for a long time and those who experienced it briefly are the same in that their happiness is exhausted at death, just like a dream. Since the pleasure previously experienced does not return, one cannot experience happiness at death but must only experience the suffering of dying.\n\nTherefore, whether one's life is long or short, the outcome is the same—which shows it is not appropriate to crave for possessions and pleasures.",

One has no power to take along even a single possession—not one's horses, mules, food, clothing, relatives, friends, monastic communities, students, or subjects—regardless of how many one may have. This demonstrates that possessions and pleasures have no real essence, as one cannot bring even the slightest of these into the next life.",
    "<6><60> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nགལ་ཏེ་རྙེད་པས་གསོན་གྱུར་ན། །\nIf, having obtained much wealth, I were to survive without dying,\n\nThis line addresses a hypothetical situation where one might live for a long time due to having obtained wealth and material gain. As the first commentary explains, this represents the condition of surviving through the acquisition of resources, while the third commentary connects this to the Buddhist notion that a longer life allows more time for Dharma practice.\n\nསྡིག་ཟད་བསོད་ནམས་བྱ་ཞེ་ན། །\nI might think, 'I will exhaust my previous misdeeds and create merit,'\n\nHere, the verse presents a justification one might offer for pursuing wealth—namely, that wealth enables one to perform virtuous actions. As the first commentary elaborates, one might think: 'I will exhaust or purify my previous misdeeds and create a vast collection of merit through upward offerings, downward generosity, painting deities, erecting supports, prostrations, circumambulations, and so forth.' The second commentary adds that this approach involves using the four powers to exhaust negative karma.\n\nརྙེད་པའི་དོན་དུ་ཁྲོས་གྱུར་ན། །\nBut if you become angry for the sake of material gain,\n\nThis line points to a contradiction in the previous reasoning. All three commentaries emphasize that if one becomes angry at others who obstruct one's pursuit of wealth—even wealth intended for virtuous purposes—one has already fallen into a negative mental state. The first commentary specifically mentions becoming angry at 'someone who creates obstacles' to one's wealth-gathering plans.\n\nབསོད་ནམས་ཟད་སྡིག་མི་འགྱུར་རམ། །\nWouldn't your merit be exhausted and negativity increase?\n\nThe final line reveals the logical problem with the earlier justification. As the first commentary powerfully states, 'a single instance of anger can destroy the accumulation of merit gathered over a thousand eons.' The second commentary similarly notes that anger exhausts 'merit accumulated over a thousand aeons' and results in negative karma. Therefore, getting angry while pursuing wealth—even for supposedly virtuous purposes—defeats the very purpose of accumulating that wealth, as anger itself destroys merit and creates negative karma, making such a pursuit ultimately self-defeating.",
    "<6><61> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'For what purpose I must live' refers to the essential aim of one's life—purifying negativities and accumulating merit. If this very purpose 'were to degenerate,' meaning if one's accumulated merit were exhausted and negativity increased instead, especially through anger, what benefit would there be? When one becomes angry for the sake of worldly gain or reputation, one can exhaust merit accumulated over a thousand eons.\n\n'Then what good is such a life' indicates that a life that 'accomplishes nothing but negativity' has lost its fundamental purpose. If you continue living only to commit negative actions, your existence has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. The verse questions the value of survival if it merely becomes a condition for one's own downfall through the creation of sin.\n\nThe implication is profound: maintaining life itself is not the goal; rather, the quality and purpose of that life matter most. Living in a way that contradicts the very purpose of human existence—spiritual development and virtue—is essentially pointless, as it would be 'meaningless' to preserve a life dedicated solely to accumulating negativity.",

This lack of faith doesn't exist independently but arises in dependence on other conditions, including even virtuous people sometimes appearing to behave improperly.\n\n'དད་པ་མེད་ལ་ཁྱོད་བཟོད་ན། །' (If you tolerate those who lack faith)\nIf you can exercise patience and not become angry with those who lack faith in others or speak unpleasantly about others, choosing instead to understand that their negative perception depends on various conditions, then you demonstrate a capacity for tolerance in this circumstance.\n\n'ཉོན་མོངས་སྐྱེས་ལ་རག་ལས་པས། །' (Since it depends on the arising of afflictions)\nSimilarly, when someone speaks unpleasantly directly to you, they do so because they are under the influence of their afflictive emotions (such as anger, jealousy, or attachment). Their harsh speech is not self-controlled but dependent on these afflictions that have arisen in their mind, leaving them with little control over their behavior.\n\n'མི་སྙན་སྨྲ་ལ་ཅིས་མི་བཟོད། །' (Why not tolerate unpleasant speech?)\nTherefore, why would you not extend the same patience toward those who speak unpleasantly to you? Given that their behavior also depends on conditions—specifically their afflictions—you should cultivate the same forbearance.

    "<6><66> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen analyzing this verse about patience, we can see that both sentient beings with consciousness (humans, animals, etc.) and non-sentient objects without consciousness (fire, water, weapons, falling rocks, etc.) can cause harm to embodied beings. These two types of causes are similar in three ways: they both result in harmful effects, they both depend on conditions, and they both lack intrinsic self-nature as agents. Given these similarities, it is illogical to single out and blame only those with consciousness while ignoring harm from non-sentient sources. Why harbor resentment and grudges specifically against sentient beings when the harm produced is essentially the same? Whether the harm comes from enemies, relatives, or inanimate objects, the reasonable response is the same—practice patience toward all forms of harm. This approach recognizes the dependent nature of causation and avoids the mistake of attributing special blame based on an artificial distinction between sentient and non-sentient causes of suffering.",

The implication is that both parties are equally at fault—one for causing harm through ignorance and the other for responding with anger, as both accumulate significant negative karma.\n\nThis verse teaches that responding with anger toward those who harm us is inappropriate, as both the original harmful action and the angry response stem from delusion, making both parties equally culpable.",

The goal is that all sentient beings—friends and enemies alike—will abandon anger toward one another and develop loving minds toward each other.

    "<6><70> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse uses a practical metaphor to explain how to handle anger. In this way, the method of reconciling grudges or the method of not generating anger is as follows: 'For example, when a fire that has burned a house then goes to a different house' refers to when a destructive fire spreads from one building to another, such as one's own home. 'The grass and so forth to which that fire spreads' indicates materials like grass, wood, and other flammable items that allow the fire to quickly spread and grow. 'That [grass and so forth] is thrown out and discarded' teaches that even if these items are somewhat useful to us but of minor importance, they should be removed from the house and discarded outside to prevent the fire from consuming everything. This action is reasonable and appropriate for protection.\n\nSimilarly, when anger's fire flares up due to attachment to relatives and others, arising from conditions where harm has come to them, and there is concern that our wealth of virtuous merit will be burned away, it is appropriate to immediately discard that basis of attachment rather than cling to it. Some might object: 'If one separates from relatives and friends, one will experience suffering,' but the verse suggests that protecting our spiritual welfare sometimes requires letting go of attachments that fuel destructive emotions.",
    "<6><71> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse describes how attachment leads to anger, which can destroy merit, and advises immediate abandonment of such attachment.\n\n**Sentence-by-sentence explanation:**\n\n**'དེ་བཞིན་གང་ལ་སེམས་ཆགས་ནས། །' (Similarly, when one's mind becomes attached...)**\nWhen one's mind becomes attached to relatives, friends, or desired objects, this attachment creates a foundation for suffering. Just as a fire spreading through a house can catch on grass and wood, threatening to destroy the entire structure and its valuables, so too does attachment create conditions for destructive emotions to arise.\n\n**'ཞེ་སྡང་མེ་ནི་མཆེད་གྱུར་པ། །' (The fire of anger flares up...)**\nWhen someone harms those we are attached to, or creates obstacles to obtaining desired objects, the fire of anger becomes inflamed and spreads throughout one's mindstream. This anger can be directed toward both enemies and even loved ones when harm befalls them.\n\n**'བསོད་ནམས་ཚིག་པར་དོགས་པ་ཡིས། །' (Out of concern that merit will be burned away...)**\nThere is genuine concern that this fire of anger will burn away the accumulation of virtuous merit gathered over a thousand eons. Just as a house fire threatens to consume valuable possessions, anger threatens to destroy the spiritual wealth one has carefully accumulated through virtuous actions.\n\n**'དེ་ནི་དེ་ཡི་མོད་ལ་དོར། །' (One should immediately abandon it.)**\nTherefore, one must immediately—in that very instant—abandon the attachment to those relatives, friends, or desired objects rather than remaining attached to them. Just as one would properly discard flammable materials to protect a house from fire, one should likewise be able to give up attachments that serve as the basis for destructive anger, even if others might mock or gossip about one's apparent lack of action on behalf of loved ones.",

Indeed, it is extremely good. Similarly, if through human sufferings such as being ridiculed by others, experiencing hunger and thirst, and other such hardships, I am freed from the far greater sufferings of hell, what is not good about that? It is entirely appropriate to accept minor suffering in order to avert greater suffering. By practicing patience toward these relatively minor human difficulties, one can be liberated from the terrible torments of the hell realms, which is tremendously beneficial. This teaches us to maintain perspective when facing difficulties in the human realm.",

I must certainly eliminate it. If I cannot tolerate even this much present suffering, then for this very reason, why do I not strive to counteract anger, which is the cause of hellish suffering? It is reasonable that I should make an effort to eliminate it.

One should not merely tolerate such suffering but should willingly embrace and take delight in it, as it sweeps away negativity and encourages virtuous qualities.\n\nThis verse appears in the context of the third section on refuting anger toward those who do good to one's enemies, which has three parts: abandoning intolerance toward those who praise and establish the reputation of one's enemies; abandoning intolerance toward those who bring happiness to one's enemies; and abandoning intolerance toward those who bring gain to one's enemies.

    "<6><83> Combined Commentary\n\nIf one does not even wish that sentient beings receive minimal benefits like food, clothing, reverence, and service, then how could one possibly desire the supreme state of Buddhahood for these same beings? It is contradictory and impossible. The verse asks a profound question: what kind of person claims to desire enlightenment for all beings while simultaneously being unable to tolerate their smallest worldly gains? \n\nAs for someone who becomes angry out of jealousy when seeing the dharmic and worldly prosperity of others, how could such a person possibly possess bodhicitta—the genuine aspiration to establish all beings in enlightenment? Clearly, they cannot, as jealousy directly causes bodhicitta to degenerate.\n\nThis is particularly relevant when religious figures like tulkus or senior lamas feel jealous toward their peers, becoming angry both at patrons making offerings and those receiving honors. Since such jealousy of others' gain and respect is incompatible with the bodhisattva path, one should strive diligently to eliminate it through proper meditation on this antidote.\n\nAs Devaśarman notes, if one cannot even wish basic prosperity for those considered enemies, the claim to wish their enlightenment becomes entirely hollow. Therefore, one should focus on lamenting one's own misdeeds rather than being jealous of others' virtues.",

They are equally not yours either way.\n\n'བྱིན་མ་བྱིན་རུང་དེས་ཅི་བྱ། །' (Whether given or not given, what does it do [for you]?)\nThe final line delivers the conclusion: since you don't possess these things either way, what difference does it make to you whether they were given to someone else or remained with the benefactor? The jealousy or concern about others receiving benefits is pointless and unreasonable. It would be more appropriate to remain in a state of equanimity rather than experiencing jealousy about possessions that were never yours to begin with.",
    "<6><85> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen you feel jealous and angry about another person's gain while desiring greater acquisitions for yourself, consider this carefully: The source text asks why you would discard the very causes that bring about gains. These causes are twofold: first, your accumulated merit and the faith of potential patrons; second, your own qualities such as moral discipline, learning, and ethical conduct.\n\nThe other person's acquisitions arise from specific causes - their previous merit, their present faith in the Dharma and teacher, and their qualities of scholarship and ethics that naturally attract patrons. If this is the case, why would you, through the power of anger born of jealousy, abandon cultivating these very causes that effortlessly bring acquisitions?\n\nYou too should cultivate merit through offerings and donations; develop genuine faith in the Dharma and teachers; maintain mindfulness and conscientiousness; behave with calm discipline that inspires the faithful; preserve pure moral discipline; become skilled in what to adopt and reject through study; and moisten your mindstream with compassion and bodhicitta.\n\nThe verse then challenges: explain for what reason would you not be angry at yourself? When you don't maintain the causes that lead patrons to respect you as worthy of offerings and that bring excellent acquisitions, then you, as a jealous person, should direct all blame inward. It is far more reasonable to be angry at yourself for not holding onto and cultivating these causes, rather than being angry at others who have successfully done so.",
    "<6><86> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'You not only fail to feel remorse for the negative actions you have committed' - This line points out how the person addressed lacks regret for their harmful deeds, which are causes for not obtaining what they desire. Instead of recognizing their own misdeeds such as taking what is not given, they remain confused about what actions to adopt and reject.\n\n'but you even desire to compete with others who possess the causes for obtaining wealth' - The commentary explains that this person, rather than acknowledging their wrongdoing, wants to compete with and envy those who have properly accumulated merit through ethical discipline and skillful actions. These others understand what to adopt and reject, unlike the person being addressed.\n\n'Such competition is entirely inappropriate' - All commentaries agree that this competitive attitude toward those who have created merit is improper and misguided. If one must compete, the proper approach would be to maintain ethical discipline and accumulate merit oneself.\n\n'Second volume' - This marks the conclusion of the second bundle or volume of the text. The commentaries note that volume lengths are not standardized, with this second volume being more extensive than the first.\n\nThe next section transitions to discussing patience toward hindrances to what is desired, which has two main parts: (1) cultivating patience toward enemies who create hindrances, and (2) cultivating patience toward hindrances affecting oneself and one's friends.

    "<6><87> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf an enemy experiences suffering, humiliation, or other misfortunes, and you become angry due to obstacles they've placed in your way, consider this: Even if an enemy is discontented and unhappy, what is there for you to be pleased about? There is no advantage to you whatsoever in rejoicing about their misfortune, whether it's death of loved ones, loss of livestock, or attacks from opponents. In fact, such pleasure brings you harm rather than benefit.\n\nFurthermore, by merely wishing in your mind 'If only my enemy would die' or 'May they be attacked' or verbally cursing them, this will not become a cause of harm to that enemy. Your mental wishes alone, such as 'May harm come to my enemy,' cannot serve as even the slightest cause of injury to them, either in this life or the next. Therefore, since not even a small part of your desired aim will be accomplished through such wishing, it is not reasonable to be angry or to hold such thoughts.\n\nSince rejoicing in others' suffering is pointless and holding such joy becomes a cause of great suffering for oneself, it is improper to take pleasure in the misfortunes of enemies.",
    "<6><88> Combined Commentary Explanation (Sentence by Sentence)\n\n**Even if by your wish that suffering is achieved for your enemy, what joy is there for you?** \nThis line questions the purpose of wishing harm on others - even if your enemy suffers according to your desire, what actual benefit or joy would you gain from it? There is absolutely no real benefit in causing others pain.\n\n**If you argue, 'But when harm befalls my enemy, my desires are fulfilled and I feel satisfied,'**\nHere the text addresses a potential objection where one might claim that seeing an enemy suffer brings mental satisfaction or fulfillment of desires.\n\n**What could be more ruinous than this intense hostility that has arisen within you?** \nThis rhetorical question points out that harboring such harmful intentions is actually the most destructive thing - not for your enemy, but for yourself. This hostility is like a fisherman of affliction setting out a hook of powerful malice that will ultimately catch you.\n\n**For this causes you to fall into lower realms, incurring the root downfall of abandoning sentient beings.**\nThe consequence of such hatred is catastrophic - it causes you to fall into lower realms in future lives. You experience the karmic consequences of your own malice, just as iron is drawn to a magnet, and you break the fundamental commitment to care for all sentient beings.\n\n**Just as fishermen catch fish with hooks and boil them, the guardians of hell will seize beings caught by the unbearable, piercing hook of hatred and place them in the cauldron of hell.**\nThis powerful metaphor illustrates how hatred works - it hooks you and delivers you to immense suffering, like fish caught and boiled. In future lives, you will experience extreme suffering in hell and other lower realms as a direct result of your own hatred.",
    "<6><89> Combined Commentary\n\nJust as fishermen catch fish with hooks and then boil them in containers, similarly, this malicious intent—which is like an unbearable, sharp hook—is deployed by afflictive emotions that resemble fishermen. This refers to the sinful karma generated by anger and the desire to cause suffering to others. Being caught by this hook of malice, one will inevitably be seized and placed by the hell guardians into the iron cauldrons or copper vessels of the hell realms, where one will be boiled and burned for a long time, causing utterly unbearable suffering. This outcome is certain.\n\nThe text then transitions to a new section with two main parts: first, refuting anger directed at worldly phenomena, and second, refuting anger that obstructs meritorious deeds. The first part has two subdivisions: addressing the inappropriateness of anger toward those who obstruct praise and fame directed at oneself, and considering the intention to benefit. Regarding praise and fame, the commentary raises the question: 'If someone obstructs my praise and fame, shouldn't I be displeased?' This introduces a discussion about the uselessness of mere praise and fame, the impropriety of considering mental pleasure as the desired goal, and the mistaken nature of holding such things as important.",

Therefore, if one can discern what is truly beneficial, one will recognize that praise and fame have absolutely no substantive benefit whatsoever.",
    "<6><91> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'If I were wise and skilled in accomplishing my own purpose' - This line questions whether someone who truly understands what benefits themselves would pursue praise and fame. All commentaries agree that if one is genuinely discerning about what constitutes real self-benefit, one would recognize that praise and fame offer no substantive benefit.\n\n'What benefit would there be for me in praise and fame?' - The commentaries unanimously assert that there is absolutely no real self-benefit in seeking praise and fame. As Commentary 2 specifically points out, such things 'do not become merit, nor do they increase lifespan, nor cause one's power to grow, nor bring physical comfort.'\n\n'If one merely seeks and desires mental pleasure' - This addresses a potential counter-argument that praise and fame provide mental pleasure and are therefore desirable. The commentaries acknowledge this objection but proceed to refute its legitimacy.\n\n'Then one would also need to indulge in bodily ornaments, or gambling with dice and horses, and so forth, as well as women and alcoholic drinks' - All three commentaries emphasize that if mere mental pleasure were the goal, then one should logically pursue all pleasure-inducing activities, including morally problematic ones like gambling, drinking alcohol, inappropriate relationships, and other worldly indulgences. Commentary 1 particularly notes that these are activities that monastics should specifically avoid, thus equating the pursuit of praise and fame with other inappropriate behaviors that violate monastic discipline.",

What purpose is served by such pleasant-sounding, praiseworthy phrases and syllables of praise? There is no purpose whatsoever - what use are these mere words?

    "<6><93> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as when a sand castle that has been made and completed for play collapses, children who understand nothing wail and lament as if they are about to faint. This presents a clear image of childish attachment to impermanent things.\n\nIn the same way, when praise and fame diminish, one's own mind becomes unhappy and tormented by grief, behaving just like an ignorant child. This represents the fourth point in the teaching, which shows how inappropriate it is to be attached to receiving praise.\n\nWhen our reputation is damaged or praise ceases, our mind becomes distressed like children crying over their collapsed sand castle. This comparison reveals the immaturity of being attached to fame and recognition, as both the sand castle and worldly praise are equally impermanent and insubstantial.\n\nIf we examine more deeply: 'This pleasure I take in praise and so forth, in what aspect of others' speech or mind do I find this pleasure?' This question helps us reflect on the nature of our attachment to praise. If our aim is to pursue what brings joy to others, then it would be more appropriate to focus on bringing joy to all beings rather than seeking personal praise.\n\nTherefore, just as children cry miserably when their sand constructions collapse, it is similarly inappropriate for one's mind to become unhappy like a child when praise and recognition fade away.",
    "<6><94> Combined Commentary\n\nFirst of all, sound (or verbal praise) has no consciousness or mind, and therefore cannot possibly have the thought 'I will praise this person.' Since sounds are merely abstract universals without real existence, it is unreasonable to take delight in them or to rejoice in mere words of praise. \n\nWhen it is stated 'it is impossible that they would think 'I shall praise this person,'' the text is emphasizing that sounds themselves have no intention or agency, so being pleased by the mere sounds of praise is illogical.\n\nIt might be argued, 'The other person who praises me is pleased,' suggesting that the happiness of another's mind (the one giving the praise) is supposedly the cause of one's own pleasure. However, the text questions this by asking: 'is that truly a cause for my own pleasure?'\n\nThis challenges us to consider what actual benefit one gains from the happiness of others who praise oneself. Since the happiness and pleasure in another's mind belongs to them alone, one does not obtain even the slightest portion of it. This applies whether the praise comes from other beings or even from oneself in self-praise, which is ultimately just childish behavior.",

If we find joy in being praised, this is unreasonable - the mere sound of praise has no mind of its own and cannot intentionally praise us.

If one analyzes both the sound of the other person's speech and their mind to determine what exactly one is rejoicing in, there is nothing substantial to be found.\n\n'Thus, mere praise is not reasonable as a cause for joy.' Since praise is merely sound with no inherent value, it is unreasonable to be attached to it or to derive happiness from it.\n\n'Being pleased by it is nothing but childish behavior.' Taking pleasure in praise is comparable to children who delight in and become attached to sand castles—it is utterly meaningless and without any essence.\n\nFurthermore, attachment to praise and fame generates all faults; it is unreasonable to be angry at those who obstruct praise and fame since they actually prevent lower rebirths and help free one from cyclic existence by preventing attachment to meaningless things.",

These distractions inflate the mind with excitement and increase attachment to gains and honors, leaving one with no time or interest in genuine Dharma practice as one becomes entangled in various social interactions and the eight worldly dharmas.\n\n**'དེས་ནི་སྐྱོ་བའང་འཇིག་པར་བྱེད། །'** (By this, they also destroy weariness/disillusionment.)\nThese distractions destroy whatever sense of disillusionment and renunciation with saṃsāra might arise in the mind.

The pursuit of worldly praise eliminates the essential disillusionment needed for spiritual progress.\n\n**'ཡོན་ཏན་ལྡན་ལ་ཕྲག་དོག་དང་། །'** (Jealousy towards those who possess good qualities.)\nFurthermore, when one possesses even slight qualities worthy of praise, one develops envy toward others who possess qualities that earn them praise and honors. For the sake of praise and gain, one becomes envious of those who possess superior qualities.

However, even toward such a person who creates obstacles to merit, it is not reasonable or appropriate to feel anger. As previously explained, since there is no austerity or supreme virtue equal to or comparable with patience, should I not abide in precisely that patience?

The merit of patience is that which does not arise when there is no one who harms, and which comes into existence when enemies or harmers are present. If those very harmers (such as enemies) are definitely the cause for the accomplishment of patience, how can those enemies and other harmers be called 'obstacles' to virtuous merit? It is not reasonable to call them 'obstacles,' because they are the causes without which patience would not arise. Since patience follows or ceases in accordance with the presence of harmers, and since that quality (the harmer) invariably accompanies and determines the merit of patience, how could one call them an 'obstacle'? It is not reasonable to consider someone who actually benefits your spiritual development as an obstacle. For the enemy is precisely the cause of patience, not its obstacle.",
    "<6><105> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'The beggar who comes at the time of giving' refers to when a person in need arrives precisely when one has the means and willingness to give a donation. In this situation, the beggar does not create an obstacle to giving but actually serves as a favorable condition or aid that enables the act of generosity to take place. Without someone to receive the gift, the meritorious act of giving cannot be completed.\n\nSimilarly, 'those who perform ordination' such as preceptors and teachers who facilitate someone's entry into monastic life should not be considered 'obstacles to ordination' but rather essential favorable conditions. They are the very cause that allows ordination to occur, as without them, the ordination cannot happen.\n\nThis illustrates an important principle: Whatever causes an effect to arise when it is present, and prevents that effect from arising when it is absent, should be recognized as the cause itself, not an obstacle. Just as a beggar enables generosity, spiritual teachers enable ordination.\n\nFurthermore, such individuals deserve our respect because they produce good qualities in us and are companions in achieving enlightenment. They provide us with rare opportunities (as 'exceptional fields' of merit), and it is appropriate to rejoice in their presence and generate an attitude of benefiting them in return. When patience increases or decreases in relation to someone's actions, that person is actually a cause of merit rather than an obstacle to it.",
    "<6><106> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn the world, beggars who serve as objects for generosity are indeed abundant, especially in this degenerate era, while those who cause harm—the field for practicing patience—are comparatively rare and difficult to find. This rarity makes enemies particularly precious as objects for developing patience.\n\nThe reason for this imbalance is clearly explained: if one does not first cause harm to others but instead works solely for their benefit, as bodhisattvas do, then generally no one will come to harm one in return. Thus, those who harm without provocation are uncommon.\n\nThis principle is evidenced by how even naturally unruly beings become pacified in the presence of realized bodhisattvas. For example, in the presence of the venerable Milarepa, natural enemies like dogs and deer would sit together listening to the Dharma, and before the royal heir Asaṅga, wolves and sheep would delight in each other's company.\n\nSince the opportunity to practice patience is rarer than the opportunity to practice generosity, and the merit gained through patience is particularly great, we should actually rejoice when encountering those who harm us rather than rejecting them. From this perspective, enemies are indeed most kind and should be valued as precious teachers of patience.",

Similarly, since enemies have become rare helpers and companions in my bodhisattva practice of cultivating patience—which is essential for the accomplishment of Buddhahood—I should only generate joy and gratitude toward these enemies and other harmful beings. These fields of patience are precious treasures that have appeared without my having to search for them, so I should view my enemies with appreciation for the opportunity they provide in my spiritual journey toward enlightenment.",

For this reason, the fruit of patience should first be dedicated and offered to this enemy who harms me.\n\nThis is fitting because the enemy is a powerful cause for cultivating my patience. As the great Master Serkhangpa stated about his own experience, his guru called Nyathub Tenzin was actually a bandit leader who had destroyed and plundered all his wealth. Yet after this experience, Serkhangpa no longer dressed as a high lama but lived as a renunciate.\n\nWithout such enemies and harmful beings, patience cannot be cultivated at all. Therefore, the fruits of cultivating patience—ultimately enlightenment itself, the supreme dharma ambrosia—should first be offered to those who harm us.\n\nThe enemy serves as the condition for patience and is thus worthy of offering, despite objections that one who lacks beneficial intention or who has harmful intention might not be a worthy object of offering.",
    "<6><109> Combined Commentary\n\nIf one objects: 'Since this enemy does not have the good intention of thinking, 'I shall help establish patience in this person's mindstream,' this enemy is not worthy of veneration or to be honored,' then why venerate even the sublime Dharma, which can serve as a cause for accomplishing vast virtue in one's mindstream? The Dharma is suitable as a cause for achieving virtue, yet it too lacks the intention of thinking, 'I shall help establish virtue in this person's mindstream' or 'I will generate virtue.' It would not be reasonable to honor the Dharma either if we follow this objection's logic, since both the enemy and the Dharma are causes without intention. This demonstrates the inconsistency in the objector's position.",
    "<6><110> Combined Commentary\n\nIf someone objects, 'Although the Dharma has no harmful intent, this enemy has the intention to harm me, so they are not an object of veneration,' I would respond as follows: If enemies were without harmful intent—like excellent physicians who strive solely to benefit me and bring me happiness—then how could I possibly develop patience in relation to them? I simply could not, since there would be no cause for patience to arise. The situation is not equivalent to that of the Dharma. Rather, it is precisely because the enemy intends harm that they become an appropriate object for practicing patience. If everyone strived to accomplish benefit and happiness like a physician does, how would I ever develop the patience of not being disturbed by harm? Therefore, far from rejecting those who cause harm, it is appropriate to recognize their value in providing opportunities for developing forbearance. Without situations requiring forbearance, how would I achieve the perfection of patience?",
    "<6><111> Combined Commentary:\n\nTherefore, since patience cannot be accomplished merely through striving for benefit or perfected in reliance upon a benevolent mind, it is specifically in dependence upon those with extremely angry minds - those who possess the characteristics of an enemy who causes harm - that patience arises in one's own mindstream. Therefore, since that very enemy is the cause for the accomplishment of patience, even though they have no intention of helping cultivate patience, they should be venerated just like the sublime Dharma because they are a cause for the accomplishment of virtue.\n\nThis section has multiple parts. The first part shows respect to sentient beings by considering them as fields of merit, establishing that beings and Buddhas are equal as fields of merit, as taught in scripture. This is followed by establishing this through reasoning and dispelling objections. The explanation includes both an extensive explanation and a summary, demonstrating that even without a benevolent mind, those who cause harm are worthy of veneration just like the sublime Dharma because they function as the actual causes that allow patience to arise.",
    "<6><112> Combined Commentary:\n\n'For this reason, the Sage taught that there are two fields: the field of sentient beings and the field of the Victorious Ones (Buddhas).' This verse establishes that both sentient beings and Buddhas serve as fields for accumulating merit, as stated in the Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: 'The field of sentient beings is the Buddha-field; from that Buddha-field, the qualities of Buddhahood are attained.' Just as crops grow when dependent on fertile land, virtues like patience flourish in one's mindstream when relying on these two fields.\n\n'Many who have pleased these [two fields] have in this way reached the perfection [of the two aims].' This confirms the logical basis for respecting both fields: numerous noble beings who have pleased sentient beings through loving-kindness and compassion, and who have delighted the Buddhas through practices such as accomplishing the sublime Dharma, have thereby reached the far shore of perfection—attaining Buddhahood itself. \n\nThe bodhisattva path demonstrates this relationship: at the beginning, one generates bodhicitta by focusing on sentient beings through compassion and on perfect enlightenment through wisdom. During the path, practices like the four immeasurables primarily depend on sentient beings, while practices like taking refuge depend on the Buddhas. Finally, at enlightenment, one establishes sentient beings in Buddhahood. Therefore, it is improper to engage in incorrect practice toward either field, and unreasonable to accept one while rejecting the other.",

When both sentient beings and the Victorious Ones (Buddhas/Conquerors) are equal as fields from which the qualities of Buddhahood—such as the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and other sublime attributes—are accomplished in one's own continuum, why do we show respect to the Victorious Ones but not in the same way to sentient beings? What kind of inconsistent approach is this?\n\nThe verse begins the third section of the text, which contains three parts: (1) refuting objections about unequal qualities, (2) establishing that devotion to both is equally a cause for Buddhahood, and (3) demonstrating the limitless merit of making offerings to sentient beings possessing even a fraction of a Buddha's qualities.\n\nBy greatly pleasing sentient beings, one attains perfect Buddhahood, which represents the ultimate culmination of all excellent qualities. Therefore, since both sentient beings and the Victorious Ones are equally causes for accomplishing the resultant qualities of Buddhahood, this unequal treatment is not in accordance with reason. If one objects, claiming that 'Buddhas, who are free from all faults and possess all qualities, are not comparable to sentient beings who are collections of faults,' this objection will be addressed in the subsequent verses.",

This extraordinary merit is considered 'the greatness of sentient beings' because the practitioner has become such a powerful object of offerings precisely due to their loving mind that takes all sentient beings as its object. Without sentient beings as the focus of that loving-kindness, such profound merit could not exist.\n\n སངས་རྒྱས་དད་པའི་བསོད་ནམས་གང་། །དེ་ཡང་སངས་རྒྱས་ཆེ་བ་ཉིད། །\n(Whatever merit comes from faith in the Buddha, that too is due to the greatness of the Buddha.)\n\nSimilarly, the merit that arises from having faith in the Buddha—whether joining just one palm in reverence, offering a single flower, or merely a drop of water—becomes an inexhaustible virtue conducive to liberation. This merit is considered 'the greatness of the Buddha' who is the object of that faith. Since both types of merit (offerings to those with loving-kindness and offerings made with faith in the Buddha) contain equivalent causal factors for achieving the qualities of Buddhahood, they are considered equal as objects of reasoning and sources of profound spiritual benefit.",
    "<6><116> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'སངས་རྒྱས་ཆོས་འགྲུབ་ཆ་ཡོད་པ། །' (Sentient beings possess the aspect of accomplishing the qualities of Buddhahood.)\nIn brief, sentient beings possess the aspect or potential for accomplishing the qualities of Buddhahood, which is the result. This refers to the Buddha-nature that exists within all sentient beings, containing the causes that can lead to the full realization of Buddha-qualities.\n\n'དེས་ན་དེ་དག་མཉམ་པར་འདོད། །' (Therefore, they are considered equal.)\nTherefore, from this perspective of potential, sentient beings and Buddhas are asserted to be equal. Both forms of faith—faith in sentient beings with loving-kindness and faith in the Buddha—contain an equal portion of the causes that lead to the accomplishment of Buddha-qualities, and thus they are considered equal from the perspective of logical analysis of potential.\n\n'ཡོན་ཏན་རྒྱ་མཚོ་མཐའ་ཡས་པའི། །' (With limitless oceans of qualities.)\nHowever, the Buddhas possess limitless oceans of qualities, such as the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique attributes. These qualities are vast and unfathomable in depth, like an endless ocean.\n\n'སངས་རྒྱས་རྣམས་དང་འགའ་མི་མཉམ། །' (No sentient being equals the Buddhas.)\nIn actual attainment, no sentient being whatsoever equals the Buddhas in terms of these qualities. Even though sentient beings have the potential to attain Buddhahood, they currently do not possess the boundless ocean of qualities that the fully awakened Buddhas have already actualized. Even if a mere fraction of the Buddha's qualities were to appear in a single individual, offering all the substances of the three realms to that person would still be insufficient.",
    "<6><117> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nEven if just a small fraction of the qualities appears in some beings who possess merely a portion of the unique collection of supreme qualities (such as the ten powers and other Buddha qualities), this verse shows their worthiness of respect. The Buddha alone possesses the complete accumulation of the two supreme collections of qualities—wisdom and merit—that are vast and unfathomable like an infinite ocean. Although no one's qualities can equal those of the Buddhas, if even a tiny fraction of these excellent qualities manifests in a single individual, then making offerings to such a person becomes tremendously meaningful. Indeed, even offering all the wealth of the three realms filled with the seven precious substances to such a being for the purpose of veneration would still be considered insufficient and small in comparison to their qualities. This demonstrates how valuable even a small portion of enlightened qualities is, and points to the incomparable worthiness of those who embody them.",

This refers to the seed or potential for awakening that exists within all beings.\n\n**'སེམས་ཅན་རྣམས་ལའང་ཡོད་པས་ན། །'** (Exists also in sentient beings)\n\nSince this portion of supreme Buddha-dharma that arises within oneself exists also in all sentient beings, they share in the same fundamental potential for enlightenment as the Buddhas themselves.\n\n**'འདི་ཙམ་དག་གིས་ཆ་བསྟུན་ནས། །'** (For this reason alone, in accordance with this aspect)\n\nConsidering this aspect alone—the fact that sentient beings possess the potential for enlightenment—we should regard them with reverence, even if their current qualities differ greatly from those of a Buddha.\n\n**'སེམས་ཅན་མཆོད་བྱར་རིགས་པར་འགྱུར། །'** (Sentient beings should properly be objects of veneration)\n\nFor this reason, sentient beings too, like the Buddha, should properly be objects of veneration and worship, deserving to be pleased and respected. Just as we show reverence to the Buddha, we should also show reverence to sentient beings.\n\nThis verse is part of the second section on showing reverence through faith in the Teacher, which demonstrates how the Teacher regards all sentient beings as his own. The passage explains the reasons why sentient beings are worthy of respect, teaching us that we should honor them because they contain the same potential for enlightenment that has fully blossomed in the Buddhas.",
    "<6><119> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFurthermore, another reason for respecting sentient beings is that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, without any deception or pretense, have sincerely become friends to all sentient beings. They regard everyone equally, whether enemies like Devadatta or friends like Rāhula, treating all as supreme friends and relatives. These holy beings, moved by great compassion and without being asked, have performed immeasurable beneficial actions, bestowing countless benefits and happiness in both this life and future lives. Considering this immense kindness, what method other than pleasing sentient beings could possibly repay them? There is no other way to repay their kindness. Indeed, there is no offering more supreme to the Buddhas than working for the benefit of sentient beings. Therefore, with gratitude and recognition of what they have done for us, one should please all sentient beings through beneficial actions, which includes enduring harm done by sentient beings, abandoning pride directed toward them, and refraining from causing them harm.",

It would be completely inappropriate for me to maintain a prideful attitude rather than performing the duties of a servant.\n\nInstead, I should abandon pride and respectfully fulfill the obligations of a servant—striving to please sentient beings just as an excellent attendant would serve their master.

In the same way, if one wishes to make offerings to the Three Jewels while simultaneously causing harm and suffering to sentient beings, there is absolutely no way to please or delight the Lord of Sages and the Victorious Ones along with their spiritual heirs, who possess great compassion.\n\nFurthermore, those who perform blood sacrifices and red offerings, who arrange flesh and blood in their mandalas and invite the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to partake of such offerings, are like inviting an elderly mother as a guest and serving her the flesh and blood of her beloved child. In such situations, the wisdom deities cannot approach these places. Instead, malevolent spirits and demons who delight in flesh and crave blood will consume these offerings, causing both the patron and the ritual master to create causes for their own ruin in this and future lives.\n\nFor this reason, there is no method by which those of great compassion can be pleased when harm is done to sentient beings, just as no amount of sensual pleasure can bring happiness to someone engulfed in flames.",

This happens through the practice of equalizing and exchanging self and others.\n\n'བདག་ཏུ་མཛད་པ་འདི་ལ་ཐེ་ཚོམ་མེད། །' - There is no doubt about this. This is exemplified by how the Buddha claimed ownership of the goose shot by Devadatta. When Buddhas first generate bodhicitta, they regard all sentient beings as their parents, siblings, or children, thus making them their own. From the path of seeing, they realize the natural equality of self and other, and upon becoming Buddhas, the object (dharmadhātu) and subject (primordial wisdom) become inseparably one.\n\n'སེམས་ཅན་ངོ་བོར་མཐོང་བ་འདི་དག་ཉིད། །' - These very beings who appear in the form of sentient beings are indeed the essence of the protectors themselves. As stated in the sutras, all sentient beings are pervaded by Buddha-nature: 'The Tathāgata-essence pervades all sentient beings.' Protector Maitreya established this through reasoning: 'Because the Buddha's body radiates, because thusness is indivisible, and because the potential exists, all embodied beings always possess Buddha-nature.'\n\n'མགོན་དེའི་བདག་ཉིད་ཅི་ཕྱིར་གུས་མི་བྱེད། །' - Why not pay homage to them? Since there is no 'Buddha' separate from sentient beings that one could venerate while rejecting sentient beings, and since paying respect to them brings about Buddhahood, it is appropriate to have faith in them and to revere them.

One gains extensive happiness comparable to that of a universal monarch. \n\nHaving understood the opposing factors such as intense anger, disinterest in virtuous dharmas, and other adversaries to spiritual development, one should strive to make one's precious human rebirth meaningful by cultivating three types of patience: remaining unperturbed toward those who harm, maintaining mental equilibrium amid suffering, and generating stable conviction through analyzing phenomena with discriminating wisdom.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes that even if one has practiced generosity and other virtues for an eon, they can be instantly destroyed by the flames of anger. Therefore, we must repeatedly generate the power of patience and never give even the slightest opportunity for anger to arise. This chapter serves as a gateway for bodhisattvas and their heirs to develop this essential paramita on the path to awakening."

    "<7><1> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThus, these six perfections are like cause and effect in sequence, with each later one depending on the earlier one. As previously explained, if one who has endured hardships and the harm inflicted by others wishes to quickly attain enlightenment, one must engage in diligence. Through generosity, one becomes detached from possessions, leading to ethical discipline. When one has ethical discipline, one can cultivate patience. Therefore, having patience toward great hardships, one should exert diligence.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this? In this way, for one who possesses diligence, the result of great enlightenment will be attained as if resting in the palm of one's hand. This is because enlightenment abides in being diligent in the conduct of the perfections.\n\nJust as without wind there is no movement of any external or internal objects—just as a lamp cannot flicker without wind—similarly without diligence, all virtuous merit of the two accumulations (merit and wisdom) will not arise. As stated in the Madhyamakāvatāra: 'All qualities follow after diligence, which is the cause of the two accumulations of merit and wisdom.'\n\nTherefore, since unsurpassed enlightenment depends on diligence, one should strive in it. When diligence is present, through the power of the virtue of the two accumulations, great enlightenment will be swiftly attained. The second section has three parts: identifying the essence of diligence, abandoning unfavorable factors, and accomplishing favorable factors.",
    "<7><2> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhat is diligence (vīrya)? It is enthusiasm toward virtue. The term 'toward virtue' specifically excludes non-virtue and neutral actions, while 'enthusiasm' distinguishes it from mere physical and verbal virtuous acts, indicating its essential nature. In terms of its divisions, diligence can be classified into four types: armor-like diligence, applied diligence, unwavering diligence, and insatiable diligence. What is commonly known as physical and verbal virtuous action being vīrya is merely designated by the name of its cause.\n\nNext, I will explain the factors contrary to diligence. There are two aspects to consider: identifying laziness with its causes and effects, and explaining the remedies for abandoning it.\n\nThe unfavorable conditions opposing diligence should be identified. These are three types of laziness: laziness that holds to lethargy (attachment to the pleasure of idleness where body and mind are unworkable); laziness of attachment to negative activities (non-virtuous or neutral actions); and laziness of self-deprecation, where one becomes discouraged about performing virtuous actions, thinking, 'I am not capable' - thus undermining oneself.\n\nThe method for abandoning these unfavorable conditions has three parts: abandoning laziness of non-application to virtue, abandoning attachment to bad actions, and abandoning discouragement or self-deprecation. The first of these has two components: identifying the causes of laziness and then abandoning them.",
    "<7><3> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'སྙོམས་ལས་བདེ་བའི་རོ་མྱང་དང་། །' (Savoring the taste of pleasurable lethargy) refers to not exerting oneself in virtue but instead remaining in a state of mental relaxation, clinging to distractions as pleasurable, and savoring that sense of pleasure that comes from inactivity.\n\n'གཉིད་ལ་བརྟེན་པའི་སྲེད་པ་ཡིས། །' (Due to craving that relies on sleep) points to the increased craving for sleep and resting on pillows and beds. When coarse conceptual thoughts are suppressed by sleep, there arises a sense of pleasure, yet one still craves it even though it later becomes suffering.\n\n'འཁོར་བའི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་མི་སྐྱོ་ལས། །' (From not being weary of the sufferings of saṃsāra) means not developing any disheartedness or fear toward the sufferings of cyclic existence. No matter how much one tries to accomplish worldly activities like subduing enemies and protecting relatives—even when they cannot be accomplished—one still continues trying without feeling discouraged about saṃsāra.\n\n'ལེ་ལོ་�ེ་བར་སྐྱེ་བར་འགྱུར། །' (Laziness will arise) explains that from these three causes—savoring pleasurable lethargy, craving sleep, and not being weary of saṃsāra's sufferings—sloth arises, which is the lack of enthusiasm for virtue. According to the Great Commentary, this sequence can also be understood as: from not being weary of the sufferings of cyclic existence comes the savoring of the pleasure of lethargy, and from that arises craving for sleep, which leads to laziness.\n\nHaving identified these causes of laziness, one should strive to overcome it by contemplating both the disadvantages in this life (particularly impermanence and the certainty of death) and the sufferings of future lives.",
    "<7><4> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**'Ensnared by the net of afflictions,'**  \nThis first line depicts how we are captured by afflictions such as attachment, aversion, and especially laziness. Just as fishermen use nets to catch fish or hunters set traps for wild animals, these negative emotions and mental states have gained control over us, driving us into dangerous situations. The afflictions act like skilled hunters who have caught us and brought us under their control.\n\n**'And having fallen into the snare of birth,'**  \nHaving been caught in the net of afflictions, we inevitably fall into the trap of cyclic existence (samsara), continuing the cycle of rebirth in the three realms. This forms connections to future existences, binding us to an endless cycle of suffering. The metaphor shows how one trap (afflictions) leads to another (rebirth), creating an inescapable situation.\n\n**'You have entered the mouth of the Lord of Death.'**  \nOnce ensnared by afflictions and trapped in the cycle of rebirth, we are led directly to death. Like animals who, once trapped, inevitably face slaughter, we too are delivered into the mouth of the merciless Lord of Death. This speaks to the certainty of death following birth and the powerlessness of beings caught in this cycle.\n\n**'Why do you still not recognize this?'**  \nThis final line is a pointed question meant to provoke urgency and awareness. Despite the obvious dangers of our situation—being caught by afflictions, trapped in rebirth, and facing certain death—many still remain ignorant or in denial. The implication is clear: having understood this predicament, one should swiftly apply oneself to virtuous activities and practice diligently instead of continuing in laziness and ignorance.",
    "<7><5> Combined Commentary\n\n'Have you not seen how your own kind—old, young, middle-aged, fellow humans, and especially your Dharma brothers and sisters of all levels—are gradually being killed one after another by the Lord of Death, who spares no one? Yet despite witnessing this obvious truth, you still cling to and rely on sleep, distractions, and laziness, making no effort to practice virtue. This behavior is extremely foolish, just like buffaloes who, seeing their companions being slaughtered one by one by the outcast butcher, show no fear and continue to lie down in ease without the slightest concern. Since you are under the power of Death and since death comes quickly and unpredictably, the time to abandon laziness is now, not at the moment of death when it will be too late. Just like the buffalo being gradually led to slaughter, you may die suddenly without having accomplished your spiritual aims if you continue to indulge in sleep rather than engaging in virtuous practice.'",
    "<7><6> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen all paths of escape are blocked and death stands watching, how can you delight in eating and sleeping with such careless enjoyment? This verse uses the powerful simile of a traveler whose paths are blocked by enemies intent on killing them. Just as such a traveler would not rest easy, neither should we when confronted with our own mortality. The 'Lord of Death' (Yama) observes us like prey marked for slaughter, blocking all routes to the 'deathless city' (liberation), yet we continue to indulge like 'careless water buffalos.' As the Jātaka wisely states: 'The Lord of Death himself has blocked all paths, yet without concern, one revels and indulges. In such a perilous state of existence, how astonishing that people remain without fear!' Rather than finding pleasure in worldly activities as days and nights quickly pass, we should recognize the extraordinary fragility of life, which as the Letter to a Friend (Suhṛllekha) reminds us, is 'more impermanent than a water bubble struck by the wind.' The ability to awaken from sleep or take another breath is actually wondrous given life's precariousness. This verse urges us not to postpone virtue until death approaches but to strive diligently now, abandoning inappropriate carelessness in the face of inevitable mortality.",
    "<7><7> Combined Commentary\n\nSince death will come swiftly, one should reflect deeply on impermanence. Particularly in this degenerate age, human life is already short and made even more precarious by numerous adverse conditions such as diseases and harmful spirits, meaning there is no certainty we will survive even until tonight. For as long as one has not been seized by the Lord of Death, one should diligently strive in virtue and accumulate the two accumulations (of merit and wisdom) as necessary provisions for the journey beyond this life. However, when the time of death approaches and one is overtaken by it, even if one suddenly wishes to abandon laziness and practice virtue, it will no longer be the right time for accomplishing anything meaningful. At that critical moment, what can possibly be done when it is too late? Nothing whatsoever of what is needed can be accomplished, and any efforts made then will be entirely pointless and meaningless.",
    "<7><8> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse illustrates the reality of impermanence and the unexpected nature of death. Since death can come at any unpredictable time, one will face different scenarios regarding one's tasks: there are things one has merely thought about in one's mind but has not made actual practical effort to accomplish ('this task has not been done'); there are things one has thought about and begun to do but is only in the initial stages ('this one has only been started'); and there are things one has half-completed but not brought to conclusion ('this one remains half-finished'). If, while in such states, death—the merciless Lord of Death—suddenly arrives without warning ('suddenly the Lord of Death arrives'), one will be filled with regret, verbally crying out 'Alas!' and thinking, 'I have been destroyed by death!' ('alas, I am destroyed by death!'). Not only will one have failed to strive when one could have exerted effort in adopting virtuous actions and abandoning non-virtuous ones, but one will also have committed negative deeds while not accomplishing any virtue whatsoever. With a mountain of regrets remaining, one will depart to the next life. This section serves as a powerful reminder that from this very moment, one should apply oneself diligently to virtue, for if one does not, one's purpose will not be fulfilled when death inevitably comes.",
    "<7><9> Combined Commentary:\n\nWhen the time of death arrives, one's face becomes swollen with the force of grief, eyes turn red, and tears stream down their face. This can be understood in two ways: either as one's own experience of sorrow at having to leave behind all relatives and possessions, or as observing the grief-stricken faces of one's loved ones who are mourning. The relatives who have gathered around the deathbed have lost all hope for the dying person's survival, their eyes reddened and swollen from weeping at the impending separation. Simultaneously, the dying person must fearfully gaze upon the terrifying faces of Yama's messengers (the karma executioners) who have come to lead them to the next life, possibly to hell. At this critical moment, the dying person experiences profound regret as they witness both the sorrow of those being left behind and glimpse the frightening reality of what awaits them, alternating between visions of this life and harbingers of the next.",
    "<7><10> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhen tormented by the memory of your own negative actions, your mind is afflicted with regret and fear. Upon hearing the sounds of the hells—the cries of 'cut! cut!' and the wailing lamentations of those suffering—you become terrified, thinking 'I too shall go there.' In your panic and fright, your body becomes soiled with impurities as you lose control of your bodily functions. Your mind becomes disoriented and intoxicated with fear, unable to recognize yourself or others. At that time, what can you possibly do? There will be nothing you can do, and no virtue can be practiced in such a state. Therefore, at this present time when you still have autonomy over yourself, rather than waiting until it is too late, you should diligently engage in virtue from this very moment. This is an exhortation to strive for methods of liberation from suffering while you still have the opportunity to do so.",
    "<7><11> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'You are like a live fish writhing': This verse compares you to a live fish taken out onto hot sand, flipping and wriggling desperately—a vivid image of extreme distress and fear of imminent death.\n\n'If even in this very life you are gripped by fear': This indicates that if you experience such unbearable fear even at the time of death in this current life (like the fish out of water), then consider how much worse your situation will be after death.\n\n'The unbearable hells that result from negative actions': This line explains that negative actions committed throughout beginningless time create the causes for rebirth in hell realms where conditions are far worse than anything experienced in this life.\n\n'What need is there to mention the sufferings': This rhetorical question emphasizes that if even the fear of death in this life is so terrifying, then the actual sufferings of hell realms are beyond description or comprehension. As referenced in the Letter to a Friend: 'If even seeing depictions of hell, hearing about it, recalling it, reading about it, or seeing it represented causes fear to arise, what need to mention experiencing the unbearable ripening itself?' This verse serves as a powerful warning not to be lazy in abandoning negative actions, as we create numerous causes for hell rebirth each day through our negative deeds.",
    "<7><12> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen touched by hot water, your extremely soft and tender, youthful body cannot endure it—the sensation causes great suffering to your delicate flesh. Yet after committing various evil deeds that will lead to rebirth in the hell realms, where you will experience the torment of intensely hot suffering, why do you remain so complacently at ease now? Such complacency is inappropriate while under the influence of laziness. Instead of this misplaced ease, you should strive in virtue with urgency, as if your head were on fire.",
    "<7><13> Combined Commentary on the Verse\n\n Verse: 'བརྩོན་མེད་འབྲས་བུ་འདོད་པ་དང་། །བཟེ་རེ་ཅན་ལ་གནོད་མང་ཞིང་། །འཆི་བས་བཟུང་བཞིན་ལྷ་འདྲ་བ། །ཀྱི་ཧུད་སྡུག་བསྔལ་དག་གིས་བཅོམ། །'\n\nHow can one who lacks even the slightest diligence desire great results such as scholarship and spiritual attainments in this life, or rebirth in pure realms in the next? These people wish for the fruit of happiness without exerting effort in virtue, which is the cause of happiness.\n\nAnd for those delicate ones who cannot endure even the slightest suffering—as it is said, 'Their patience is smaller than that of a mosquito, their sensitivity tighter than a drum'—many harms will arise in both this life and the next. These sensitive beings, unable to bear even minor hardships, will inevitably experience numerous sufferings.\n\nThough certainly seized by death, by the Lord of Death, they are like gods distracted by sense pleasures, neither remembering death nor acting as if death will come. While already in death's grasp, they foolishly hope to live long like gods, not obtaining what they wish for but obtaining what they do not wish for.\n\nAlas! Those who delight in distractions and engage in negative actions will be overwhelmed by the suffering of death and other unwanted experiences in all future lives. This expression of 'alas!' is spoken out of compassion for these pitiful beings who are crushed by sufferings. Therefore, it is right to remember death and strive in virtue.",
    "<7><14> Combined Commentary\n\nBy relying on this boat of the human body with its freedoms and advantages (dal 'byor), one can be liberated from the great river of suffering of the three realms of cyclic existence. This verse shows the great meaning and value of having obtained a human rebirth with leisure and endowments, which serves as an excellent vessel for crossing over samsara's sufferings. Since the causes for obtaining such a precious human body are extremely rare to cultivate and the proper conditions are difficult to gather, this boat will be extremely difficult to find again in the future. Therefore, addressing those who are deluded about what to adopt and what to abandon, the verse admonishes: when you have found this rare and precious boat, do not fall asleep through laziness during this crucial time when you can strive in virtue. Instead, abandoning all forms of laziness, one should practice diligently on the paths of the three scopes of persons—lesser, middling, and greater—thereby crossing over the river of cyclic existence and achieving liberation. This teaches the urgent necessity of striving in spiritual practice while one possesses the difficult-to-find freedoms and advantages of human rebirth.",
    "<7><15> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n**དགའ་བའི་རྒྱུ་ནི་མཐའ་ཡས་པའི། །དམ་ཆོས་དགའ་བའི་མཆོག་སྤངས་ནས། །སྡུག་བསྔལ་རྒྱུ་ཡིས་གཡེང་བ་དང་། །རྒོད་སོགས་ལ་ཁྱོད་ཅི་ཕྱིར་དགའ། །**\n\nThis verse asks: 'Having abandoned the supreme joy of the sublime Dharma, which is the limitless source of happiness, why do you delight in distractions caused by sources of suffering, and in frivolity and so forth?'\n\nThe sublime Dharma referenced here is truly a boundless source of joy. At the beginning, when first heard, it is like nectar for the ears, transforming lack of faith into genuine faith. In the middle stage, when contemplated, it dispels all conceptual thoughts that distract the mind. Finally, during meditation, it gives rise to the wisdom of complete liberation in one's mindstream. Being virtuous at the beginning, middle, and end, the Dharma is the supreme source of joy in this life and all future lives.\n\nThis verse forms part of the teaching on abandoning the laziness of discouragement. It begins by questioning why one would abandon study and practice of the three scriptural collections and the three trainings of the path, instead delighting in activities that cause unbearable suffering both now and in the future. These distractions include worldly concerns such as subduing enemies, protecting relatives, commerce, farming, household management, and pursuing wealth—activities that leave no leisure during the day and no rest at night.\n\nThe verse also questions why one would find pleasure in physical agitation (through games, running, and jumping), verbal agitation (through meaningless talk stemming from attachment and aversion, or loud laughter), and mental agitation (through following various meaningless thoughts about past, present, and future). All these activities disturb both body and mind, contradicting the Dharma and becoming causes of suffering rather than happiness.\n\nThe implicit message is that one should abandon such distractions and instead delight in the true sources of joy found in Dharma practice, as this is the path to overcoming laziness and accomplishing enlightenment.",
    "<7><16> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'སྒྱིད་ལུག་མེད་དང་དཔུང་ཚོགས་དང་། །' (Without discouragement and gathering forces)\nJust as kings conquer through four principles, bodhisattvas must similarly conquer what is to be abandoned. First, they must develop armor-like diligence with a mind free from discouragement toward virtue. This unwavering determination serves as protection against obstacles. Then, they must gather the four collections of allies or divisions of forces (which will be explained in more detail later), amassing the two accumulations as their army through applied diligence.\n\n'ལྷུར་བླང་བདག་ཉིད་དབང་བྱ་དང་། །' (Diligently undertake and control oneself)\nWith mindfulness and awareness, the bodhisattva must diligently practice what is to be adopted and rejected, focusing their attention like a king governing their kingdom. They must bring the three doors of their being (body, speech, and mind) under the power of antidotes, like a minister serving their ruler. This involves developing mastery over oneself through the pliancy of body and mind.\n\n'བདག་དང་གཞན་དུ་མཉམ་པ་དང་། །' (Equalizing self and other)\nFirst, one should meditate on the mind of awakening that views self and other as equal. This is the foundational practice that recognizes the fundamental sameness of all beings in wanting happiness and avoiding suffering.\n\n'བདག་དང་གཞན་དུ་བརྗེ་བར་གྱིས། །' (Exchange self and other)\nFinally, one should joyfully and diligently practice the meditation on the mind of awakening that exchanges self for other. This profound practice is essential for those with sharp faculties who seek to apply diligence, accumulate limitless stores of merit, and undertake extremely difficult conduct over countless eons to attain full Buddhahood.",
    "<7><17> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བདག་གིས་བྱང་ཆུབ་ག་ལ་ཞེས། །' (How could I ever attain enlightenment?)\nOne should not become discouraged or disheartened, thinking, 'How could someone like me, who has many afflictions and great negativities, ever attain unsurpassed enlightenment?' This represents the doubt that may arise in practitioners who feel unworthy or incapable of reaching enlightenment.\n\n'སྒྱིད་ལུག་པར་ནི་མི་བྱ་སྟེ། །' (One should not be discouraged)\nOne should not belittle oneself, lose heart, or become disheartened about one's potential to achieve enlightenment. This is an encouragement against the mental state of discouragement that prevents practice. Even those who have been born as animals and insects will eventually attain enlightenment, so humans should certainly not abandon their diligence.\n\n'འདི་ལྟར་དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པ་ནི། །' (For thus the Tathāgata)\nFor the Tathāgata, the all-knowing Buddha who has gone thus, has complete wisdom and authority on this matter. This line reminds us that this teaching comes from the Buddha himself, whose words are trustworthy and definitive.\n\n'བདེན་པ་གསུང་བས་བདེན་འདི་གསུངས། །' (Who speaks only truth, has spoken this truth)\nThe Buddha speaks only truth and does not lie, and has pronounced these truthful, non-deceptive words that everyone can attain enlightenment. As stated in the Subāhu-paripṛcchā, even beings born as animals will eventually awaken to unsurpassable enlightenment, so humans should never abandon their diligence toward this goal. Since there is no reason for the Buddha to speak falsely, his words are worthy of complete trust.",

As explained in the Uttaratantra: 'Because the perfect buddha's form emanates, because suchness is indivisible, and because the lineage exists, all embodied beings always possess the buddha-essence.' There are two types of lineage: the naturally abiding lineage, which is the nature of mind itself and pervades all beings, and the developed lineage, which emerges through cultivation and purification of obscurations.\n\nThis verse should inspire us to reflect: 'If I, being superior by birth as a human, possessing exceptional aspiration, and understanding what to adopt and abandon for achieving enlightenment, were to undertake these practices without abandoning them, why would I not attain enlightenment? I certainly can attain it.' As taught in the 'Teaching of Dreams': 'Even one with minimal qualities can attain enlightenment through superior intention and protection.'",
    "<7><19> Combined Commentary\n\nI, who am born as a human with a noble lineage, have attained the supreme class of beings among the six realms of existence. This human birth is distinguished as superior because, unlike other beings, I can speak and understand meaning.\n\nSince I possess the wisdom to recognize what is beneficial and harmful through adopting virtuous actions and rejecting non-virtuous ones, I have the capacity to discern what to adopt and what to abandon for accomplishing awakening.\n\nIf I do not become discouraged but rather generate bodhicitta and diligently practice the bodhisattva conduct without abandoning it, why would I not attain great enlightenment? This addresses the inappropriateness of fearing the austerities of the path.\n\nI should certainly think: 'I will definitely attain enlightenment.' For it is taught that even flies, honeybees, and similar insects that have generated diligence and accumulated the two accumulations can attain unsurpassed awakening. Even one who has initially generated the mind for supreme enlightenment with deceit will eventually attain Buddhahood. Therefore, I who have all the necessary conditions—human birth, discernment between beneficial and harmful, and the bodhisattva path—have no reason to doubt my ability to achieve enlightenment.\n\nThis explanation contains two main parts: the absence of causes for discouragement, and the presence of causes for enthusiasm. The first part addresses dispelling fear regarding the difficulty of practice and overcoming weariness due to the long duration of the path.",
    "<7><20> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འོན་ཏེ་རྐང་ལག་ལ་སོགས་པ། །' (But if you say, 'My legs, arms, and so forth...')\nThis line introduces a hesitation or objection that might arise in the mind of a practitioner on the bodhisattva path. After hearing that one should strive diligently toward enlightenment, the practitioner expresses concern about the sacrifices required, particularly the giving away of one's limbs and body parts as mentioned in the practices of generosity.\n\n'བཏང་དགོས་བདག་ནི་འཇིགས་ཤེ་ན། །' (I must give these away, and I am afraid...')\nHere, the practitioner openly admits their fear of the difficult practices of generosity, specifically the thought of having to give away parts of their body. This represents a common hesitation on the path, where one recognizes the demanding nature of the bodhisattva practices but feels afraid of the personal sacrifice involved.\n\n'ལྕི་དང་ཡང་བ་མ་དཔྱད་པར། །' (Without examining what is heavy and what is light...)\nThis line points to the root of the fear—a failure to properly examine and distinguish between what is truly serious (heavy) and what is relatively insignificant (light). The commentaries explain that this refers to not properly distinguishing between the greater suffering of remaining in samsara versus the lesser suffering of practicing generosity.\n\n'རྨོངས་པས་བདག་ནི་འཇིགས་པར་ཟད། །' (Due to confusion, I am merely afraid.)\nThe final line concludes that this fear stems entirely from confusion or ignorance. The commentaries elaborate that this confusion involves failing to recognize that we have already suffered countless bodily torments throughout beginningless samsara to no purpose, whereas sacrifices made on the path to enlightenment have profound purpose. This fear is therefore misplaced—we are afraid of what need not be feared while remaining unafraid of the truly fearsome prospect of continued suffering in samsara.",
    "<7><21> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse addresses our fear of the difficult practices on the bodhisattva path. One might think: 'I am unable to perform those difficult practices that require giving away legs, arms, and head as offerings,' thus hesitating to generate bodhicitta. \n\nHowever, this fear arises from not properly examining the distinction between greater and lesser suffering. Since beginningless time, while wandering in samsara, for countless billions of eons, we have experienced the hell realms—not just once but innumerable times—where our bodies were cut with swords, pierced with daggers, burned in hell-fire, and slashed with blazing saws. Despite enduring these meaningless torments countless times, our bodies were merely wasted to no purpose; we did not complete the accumulations and thus did not attain great enlightenment.\n\nThe verse points out this tragic irony: without having practiced austerities for the sake of enlightenment, we will continue experiencing these terrible sufferings in samsara anyway, but without any spiritual benefit. Therefore, rather than fearing the difficult practices of the bodhisattva path, we should recognize that directing our suffering toward enlightenment gives meaning to what would otherwise be pointless torment.",

When these medical treatments are performed, patients must endure these temporary sufferings for the sake of curing their ailments. The physicians create a disease-free state through these uncomfortable but necessary interventions.\n\n**དེ་བས་སྡུག་བསྔལ་མང་པོ་དག །གཞོམ་ཕྱིར་མི་བདེ་ཆུང་བཟོད་བྱ། །**\n(Therefore, to overcome numerous sufferings, one should endure minor discomforts.)\n\nSimilarly, in order to completely destroy and eliminate the great and numerous sufferings of the three realms of cyclic existence (samsara) for oneself and others, one must accept and endure the minor discomforts of austerities and spiritual practices. These hardships undertaken to attain enlightenment involve very minor suffering compared to the immense sufferings they help overcome. Therefore, for the sake of pacifying immeasurable suffering for oneself and countless others over limitless time, one should willingly endure these relatively minor discomforts, just as a patient accepts temporary pain from medical procedures to cure a serious disease.",
    "<7><24> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'གསོ་དཔྱད་ཕལ་པ་འདི་འདྲ་བ། །' (Such ordinary medical treatments) - The Supreme Physician, Buddha, does not employ ordinary medical treatments such as bloodletting, cauterization, puncturing, and other harsh procedures that cause suffering. These also refer to extreme austerities that some practitioners mistakenly believe are necessary for spiritual advancement.\n\n'སྨན་པ་མཆོག་གིས་མ་མཛད་དེ། །' (The supreme physician does not employ) - Lord Buddha, as the ultimate healer, rejected such harsh methods while pursuing awakening. Instead of extreme self-mortification or ordinary medical procedures that cause pain, the Buddha discovered a more effective approach.\n\n'ཆོ་ག་ཤིན་ཏུ་འཇམ་པོ་ཡིས། །' (Through extremely gentle procedures) - Through extremely gentle methods—avoiding both the extremes of excessive austerity and sensual indulgence—Buddha taught easy-to-accomplish practices. Seated comfortably in cross-legged posture, with perfect mindfulness established, he demonstrated a middle way that is accessible and sustainable.\n\n'ནད་ཆེན་དཔག་མེད་གསོ་བར་མཛད། །' (He heals immeasurable great diseases) - Through this gentle approach, Buddha heals the immeasurable great diseases—the two obscurations including the 84,000 afflictions and other samsaric chronic illnesses—that cause beings to wander in cyclic existence. This teaching suggests that beginners should not engage in difficult austerities like giving away one's body, but should follow the gentle middle path that effectively leads to the complete eradication of afflictive emotions and the attainment of happiness.",
    "<7><25> Combined Commentary:\n\nInitially, for those who find giving extremely difficult and are not yet accustomed to generosity, the Buddha, the Guide and Blessed One, first encourages practitioners to begin with small acts of giving such as vegetables, prepared food, small portions of rice, or other minor items of inferior value. For the very beginners, one should even mentally practice giving from one hand to another while verbally expressing this intention. The Buddha skillfully introduces his disciples to these modest practices of giving as a starting point. After becoming accustomed to these small acts and no longer experiencing mental difficulty with them, one gradually progresses to greater and greater forms of generosity. Eventually, later on, having developed this capacity through gradual training, one becomes capable of extraordinary generosity, giving away even one's own flesh and blood without reservation or hesitation.",

There is not the slightest difficulty at all. When one understands all phenomena as equal, gold and stone become equal, space and the palm of one's hand become equal. One understands phenomena such as pleasure and pain, good and bad as being like dreams and illusions, and thus has no fear of anything. This is why it is inappropriate to fear austerities on the bodhisattva path. As stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra: 'Realizing that all phenomena are like illusions, and that birth is like going to a pleasure garden, one has no fear of afflictions and suffering, whether in times of prosperity or in times of decline.'\n\nThis verse begins the fourth section of the text, which addresses how skilled practitioners experience no suffering from austerities while untrained persons on the path experience physical and mental discomfort. This understanding eventually leads to the conclusion that great bodhisattvas have no cause for weariness while remaining in saṃsāra for the benefit of others.",
    "<7><27> Combined Commentary on the Source Text:\n\nSince bodhisattvas have completely abandoned all negative deeds (སྡིག་པ་སྤངས་ཕྱིར་), there is no physical suffering whatsoever in their bodies (སྡུག་བསྔལ་མེད), just as a lotus grows from mud yet remains unstained by it. This abandonment of negativities encompasses all harmful actions of body, speech, and mind.\n\nBecause bodhisattvas are skilled and wise (མཁས་པའི་ཕྱིར་ན་) in understanding the true nature of phenomena and have realized the meaning of selflessness, there is no mental unhappiness or dissatisfaction in their minds (མི་དགའ་མེད). Their wisdom allows them to give away even their bodies with a pure compassionate intention without experiencing mental distress.\n\nThis is because (འདི་ལྟར་) what actually harms ordinary beings is incorrect conceptualization (ལོག་པར་རྟོག་པ་དང་) that clings to a self where there is selflessness, fixating on 'I' and 'mine' where no such entities truly exist.\n\nAnd it is negative actions (སྡིག་པས་) such as killing, stealing and other harmful deeds that harm both the mind and body (སེམས་དང་ལུས་ལ་གནོད), generating suffering. For great bodhisattvas, these causes of harm have been completely reversed, as they remain in samsara without being tainted by its faults.",
    "<7><28> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བསོད་ནམས་ཀྱིས་ནི་ལུས་བདེ་ལ། །' (Through merit, the body is at ease.)\nThrough the power of accumulating merit via generosity and other virtuous actions, bodhisattvas experience physical well-being and comfort. Their bodies become free from physical suffering wherever they dwell, enjoying the positive fruits of their meritorious actions.\n\n'མཁས་པ་ཡིས་ནི་སེམས་བདེ་ན། །' (Through wisdom, the mind is happy.)\nThrough their wisdom, mastery of what to adopt and reject, and particularly through their realization of selflessness and understanding of emptiness, bodhisattvas' minds become joyful and happy like that of Bodhisattva Sadāprarudita (Ever-Weeping). This wisdom-derived happiness brings mental ease and freedom from displeasure.\n\n'གཞན་དོན་འཁོར་བར་གནས་ཀྱང་ནི། །' (Though they remain in saṃsāra for the benefit of others,)\nEven though bodhisattvas purposely remain within the three realms of saṃsāra specifically for the sake of benefiting other sentient beings, they are not affected by the typical faults and sufferings that characterize cyclic existence. They maintain their presence there by choice and with purpose.\n\n'སྙིང་རྗེ་ཅན་དག་ཅི་སྟེ་སྐྱོ། །' (Why would the compassionate ones become weary?)\nThese compassionate heirs of the Conqueror, the bodhisattvas, have absolutely no reason to become discouraged or weary. Since they experience physical comfort through merit and mental happiness through wisdom, there is no cause for weariness even while dwelling in saṃsāra for others' benefit. They will not become discouraged in their noble work.",
    "<7><29> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse is clarifying how bodhisattvas, through the power of bodhicitta (the mind of awakening), excel in two crucial ways: First, they completely exhaust previous negativities and sins which are the causes of suffering—as explained earlier in verses such as 'Even extremely grave sins...' and 'At the end of time...' and as stated in 'Even when heedless, the force of merit...' Second, they accumulate vast oceans of merit which are the causes of happiness, as in each moment the six perfections such as generosity increase more and more within them. For these two reasons—their superior capacity to purify negative karma and to gather immense merit and wisdom—it is explicitly taught that bodhisattvas are superior to the śrāvakas (hearers) in traversing the spiritual path. Some commentators like Śer and Lha specifically interpret this superiority as being 'swifter in accomplishing enlightenment than the śrāvakas,' highlighting the efficiency of the bodhisattva path compared to the śrāvaka approach.",
    "<7><30> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTherefore, having mounted the excellent steed of bodhichitta, which eliminates all mental weariness and physical exhaustion without exception, who with discernment—one who understands the difference between faults and virtues—would become discouraged and disheartened? When progressing from happiness to happiness along the path that does not dwell at the extremes of samsara and nirvana, advancing to progressively higher states of bliss, no wise person who truly understands the mind would become disheartened. No one who desires their own welfare would become discouraged in practicing the conduct. Yet one might think, 'I cannot accomplish the welfare of sentient beings,' but this doubt is unfounded when supported by bodhichitta.\n\nThis verse is part of the section on enhancing the power of diligence, specifically addressing the power of favorable conditions for diligence. It shows how bodhichitta serves as the foundation that makes the spiritual journey sustainable and increasingly joyful rather than exhausting.",
    "<7><31> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn order to accomplish the welfare of sentient beings, one must generate a battalion of forces that vanquish the adversaries of diligence. Just as a universal monarch relies on a four-fold army to establish others in virtue, likewise the Buddha, as a Dharma universal monarch, bestows four types of forces upon bodhisattva heirs for this purpose.\n\nThese four powers that serve as favorable conditions for diligence are: the force of aspiration, the force of steadfastness, the force of joy, and the force of relinquishment.\n\nThe power of aspiration refers to the cultivation of enthusiasm for undertaking what should be accepted and rejected after contemplating karma and its results. Although the text mentions 'adhimukti' (firm conviction), the Great Commentary clarifies that 'chanda' (aspiration) refers to desiring virtue, and Master Dpang Lotsāwa noted that in the Sanskrit text these appear as 'chanda.'\n\nThe power of steadfastness means not engaging in random actions without investigation, but rather bringing to completion what one has carefully undertaken and not turning back from begun endeavors.\n\nThe power of joy involves engaging in diligence without interruption and without satiation, like a child absorbed in play, with enthusiasm that continues to increase.\n\nThe power of relinquishment means resting when the body and mind become weary from exertion, and then immediately resuming effort as soon as one is refreshed, particularly when the occasion calls for significant purpose.\n\nThese powers arise based on the root of aspiration. This aspiration must be generated by repeatedly contemplating and meditating on the fear and dread of the varieties of suffering that result from non-virtue, and by contemplating the benefits of liberation from these sufferings, which are the benefits of aspiration itself.",
    "<7><32> Combined Commentary\n\nHaving thus abandoned the unfavorable factors—namely the three types of laziness and other opposing elements such as recognizing one's ability to accomplish virtuous qualities yet not engaging in them, or becoming discouraged thinking 'how could I possibly accomplish this?'—one should strive to increase diligence. By what means? Through the powers explained in this verse: devotional aspiration (mos pa), which is earnest interest in the sublime Dharma; firmness or pride (nga rgyal), which represents steadfastness that does not turn back from one's undertaking; delight or joy (dga' ba), which means taking exceptional pleasure in one's practice; and abandonment (dor ba), which means giving up what should be relinquished when necessary. Having gathered these four forces, one should earnestly adopt what is to be practiced and reject what is to be abandoned. Through the powers of mastery (dbang bsgyur) over body and mind and through strength (stobs), one should endeavor to increase diligence progressively.\n\nThe second section of this teaching contains several parts: gathering the four forces and developing the powers of mindfulness and awareness. The first has four divisions: the force of aspiration, the force of steadfastness, the force of joy, and the force of abandonment. Each of these forces has its own subsections explaining their objects, benefits, causes, and methods of cultivation.",

Yet how astonishing and lamentable that I have never developed familiarity with even a fraction of these qualities, instead wasting this rare and precious human rebirth of leisure and opportunity on meaningless pursuits that serve only this life and future lives!

    "<7><40> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དགེ་བའི་ཕྱོགས་ནི་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི། །' (The root of all aspects of virtue)\n\nThe root of all aspects of virtue that lead to higher rebirth and definite excellence is, as stated in the Candrapradīpa Sūtra (Moon Lamp Sutra), devotion or faithful conviction to the Dharma. This is further emphasized in the Sutra Requested by Sāgaramati, which states: 'The root of all virtuous qualities is devotion.' Those who lack this devotion to the Dharma, as indicated in the Great Commentary, experience a lack of happiness. What wise person would abandon devotion to the Dharma?\n\n'རྩ་བ་མོས་པར་ཐུབ་པས་གསུངས། །' (The Sage taught that aspiration is the root)\n\nThis truth was taught by the Sage, the Buddha himself. As further confirmed in the Array of Mañjuśrī's Realm: 'All phenomena are conditions, resting primarily on aspiration. Whatever aspirational prayers one makes, such fruits will be obtained.' Therefore, the quality of one's practice directly correlates with the level of one's aspiration—excellent aspiration produces an excellent practitioner; middling aspiration, a middling practitioner; and lesser aspiration, a lesser practitioner.\n\n'དེ་ཡི་རྩ་བ་རྟག་ཏུ་ནི། །' (The root of that, at all times)\n\nThe root of this devotion or aspiration to the holy Dharma is, at all times, a deep conviction in the law of karma. If one does not properly find certainty in karma and its effects, one will not find certainty in any Dharma that pleases the Victorious One. Some claim to have found certainty in emptiness while disregarding karma and its effects, but this indicates a complete misunderstanding of emptiness.\n\n'རྣམ་སྨིན་འབྲས་བུ་བསྒོམས་པས་སོ། །' (Is meditation on the ripened results)\n\nThis conviction is cultivated through meditation on the ripened results of virtuous and non-virtuous actions—that they are never wasted and will definitely be experienced individually as happiness or suffering. Rather than disparaging oneself with thoughts like 'How could I possibly maintain ethical discipline?' one should look upward like a bird placed at the foundation of a house. Through consistent effort in ethical discipline and engagement in hearing, contemplation, and meditation, one will gradually develop the necessary qualities. One should repeatedly contemplate this truth with faith in cause and effect.",

This verse teaches the general relationship between cause and effect, demonstrating that all suffering in this and future lives stems from negative actions. Therefore, one should strive diligently to abandon such negative conduct.",
    "<7><42> Combined Commentary:\n\nBy performing virtuous actions motivated by mental aspiration or intention (yid la bsams pa), wherever one goes and takes rebirth, in that very place, due to previously accumulated merit and virtuous karma, one will be honored with the excellent qualities and abundant rewards of ripened fruition. These virtuous deeds undertaken through the power of intention (ʼdun pa) will naturally manifest their positive results. This is not merely nominal or verbal—the relationship between virtuous action and its pleasant results follows natural law. Just like Prince Puṇyabala (Merit-strength) who, upon entering a poor person's home, caused a great inexhaustible treasure to appear, those who generate a mind of renunciation and perform virtuous actions consciously will experience the gifts of their meritorious deeds in whatever realm they are reborn. Conversely, even though a person who commits negative actions may desire happiness, by this same natural law, they will encounter suffering as a result of those actions. Therefore, one should strive to abandon negative actions and cultivate virtue, which leads to rebirth in realms such as Sukhāvatī where one can experience the full fruition of meritorious deeds.",
    "<7><43> Combined Commentary\n\nSimilarly, those who commit evil and non-virtuous actions, though they desire happiness, wherever they go and are born, in those very places they are thoroughly destroyed by the ripening of those previously accumulated evil deeds, which are like being struck by sharp weapons of suffering sensations. As stated in the 'Advice to the King': 'When a king departs, overcome by time, neither his wealth, friends, nor relatives follow him. Wherever and to whatever place a person goes, their actions follow them like a shadow.'\n\nIt does not merely follow from wishing for happiness or suffering; rather, by natural law, the qualities of the result (referring to the natural character of the result) will manifest accordingly. Regarding such mixed karma, there are four possibilities of projecting and completing karma: First, when both the projecting karma is virtuous and the completing karma is also virtuous, one is born in a higher realm and enjoys happiness throughout one's life. Second, when both the projecting karma is non-virtuous and the completing karma is also non-virtuous, one is born in hell and experiences suffering throughout one's life. \n\nThird, when the projecting karma is virtuous, causing one to be born as a deity in the celestial realm, but the completing karma is non-virtuous, resulting in one having no prosperity and experiencing suffering. Fourth, when the projecting karma is non-virtuous but the completing karma is virtuous, like some daughters of good families or certain prosperous animals.\n\nFurthermore, there are cases of mixed karma where one experiences alternating happiness and suffering, such as when one is born in an ephemeral hell but takes vows of virtue, or when born as a human with varying experiences throughout different life stages. In short, whether born in higher or lower realms, all experiences of pleasure and pain are the unfailing results of virtuous and non-virtuous actions. Therefore, one should strive to abandon negative actions.",
    "<7><44> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse describes the special qualities of those born in pure realms like Sukhāvatī as a result of completely pure virtuous karma. Unlike ordinary birth in the constricted, foul-smelling, and hot confines of a womb, these fortunate beings 'dwell in the spacious, fragrant, and cool center of lotus flowers' (རྒྱ་ཆེ་དྲི་བཟང་བསིལ་བའི་པདྨའི་སྙིང་པོར་གནས།), experiencing comfort rather than suffering. Rather than being nourished by impure substances like phlegmatic fluids, 'they develop their bodily splendor through consuming the nectar of Dharma taught by the sweet voice of the Victorious One' (རྒྱལ་བའི་གསུང་སྙན་ཟས་ཀྱིས་གཟི་བརྗིད་བསྐྱེད་བྱས་པ།), referring to Buddha's teachings with their sixty melodious aspects. Instead of enduring the painful passage through a birth canal, 'they possess supreme bodies that emerge from lotus flowers that are opened and made to bloom by the light rays emanating from the Buddha' (ཐུབ་འོད་ཀྱིས་རྒྱས་པདྨ་ལས་བྱུང་ལུས་མཆོག་ཅན།), a miraculous and painless birth. Finally, unlike ordinary children who are raised by worldly parents, 'they have the excellent fortune of abiding before Victorious Ones such as Buddha Amitābha, being nurtured by their teachings, and becoming true children of the Sugatas through pure virtue' (རྒྱལ་བའི་མདུན་གནས་བདེ་གཤེགས་སྲས་སུ་དགེ་བས་འགྱུར།). These four special qualities—of birthplace, nourishment, manner of birth, and guardianship—arise solely from completely pure virtuous actions.",

This flaying causes unimaginable anguish to these beings. Next, molten copper which has been melted by fires much hotter than even the fires at the end of time is poured both externally and internally onto the body, burning it unbearably. While this is happening, the flesh is struck and cut with sharp weapons such as blazing swords and short spears, chopping it into hundreds of pieces and scattering them about. Then these beings fall onto iron ground that is intensely ablaze, experiencing endless, immense suffering. All these horrific experiences are the result of numerous unwholesome actions one has committed, particularly grave negative deeds such as the five heinous crimes (killing one's father, mother, or an arhat, causing a schism in the Sangha, or drawing blood from a Buddha with harmful intent) and rejecting the Dharma. These are the fruits of greatly sinful actions performed without remorse, which are exclusively dark karma.",
    "<7><46> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTherefore, having properly reflected on cause and effect, one should cultivate aspiration toward virtue, abandon non-virtuous actions, and be single-mindedly devoted to virtuous actions with intense interest. One should meditate with devotion through the gateway of faith, having respect and confidence in what should be adopted and rejected.\n\nRegarding the power of stability (or steadfastness), there are two aspects: steadfastness in diligence and steadfastness in persevering after having begun. The first involves undertaking virtuous actions after proper investigation.\n\nAs stated in the sixth dedication chapter of the noble Vajra-dhvaja Sūtra (or Gaṇḍavyūha section of the Avatamsaka): 'Just as the rising sun does not turn back due to defects such as blind people or uneven mountains, but illuminates all suitable regions, likewise a bodhisattva who rises for the benefit of others does not turn back due to the various faults of sentient beings, but brings suitable disciples to maturity and liberation.'\n\nThrough this ritual method or procedure, having begun virtuous activities for the benefit of others, one should cultivate the pride of thinking, 'I can definitely accomplish whatever I undertake,' developing great courage and bringing these activities to completion.",

This pride should not be cultivated at the beginning of practice, but rather when one has actually engaged in practice and experiences mental discouragement.\n\n'གསུམ་པོ་དག་ལ་ང་རྒྱལ་བྱ། །' (In these three, one should cultivate pride)\nAfter engaging in bodhisattva activity, one should generate a confident pride without timidity regarding these three things. This means thinking: 'I alone must accomplish remedial actions,' 'I will not fall under the power of afflictions,' and 'Why should I not be able to abandon faults and achieve qualities?'\n\n'བདག་ཉིད་གཅིག་པུས་བྱའོ་ཞེས། །' (Thinking, 'I alone shall do this')\nWhen seeing a task that others might appropriately do, one generates mental strength with the thought 'I alone will do this.' Just as the sun alone illuminates the four continents without depending on others, similarly, a bodhisattva should think: 'I, skilled in the methods of emptiness and great compassion, will alone accomplish the purpose of maturing and liberating sentient beings equal to space.'\n\n'འདི་ནི་ལས་ཀྱི་ང་རྒྱལ་ཉིད། །' (This is indeed pride in action)\nThis conviction of thinking 'I alone shall perform all virtuous actions that benefit myself and others' constitutes pride in action itself. One should accomplish the activities benefiting beings without depending on others, by oneself. This is not an arrogant pride but rather a courageous determination that enables one to take responsibility even for tasks that others might do.",

    "<7><51> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen others engage in lowly activities of this world—such as conquering enemies, caring for relatives, commerce, farming, carrying burdens, or gathering and cutting grass—how appropriate is it for me to remain idle without assisting them? \n\nInstead of staying comfortably idle, I who am carrying great sentient beings on my head should help with those lowly tasks that do not give rise to negativity. There are examples of great practitioners doing this: Dromtönpa carried a burden for an old tantric practitioner himself, and Dampa from India carried the burden of the yellow-clad Acārya Smara.\n\nHowever, if I refrain from doing such work out of pride, thinking, 'This work is lowly, but I am superior,' then I should not act with such pride. It is best for me to be without the affliction of pride, as it is supreme for a bodhisattva to be free from ordinary pride.\n\nAlternatively, when others engage in worldly activities, it might be inappropriate for me to stay engaged in these lowly tasks; instead, I should engage in the bodhisattva's conduct of the six perfections. Yet even then, I should abandon pride since it leads to rebirth in lower realms.\n\nThe commentary continues with sections on the fault of lacking confidence in one's abilities, the benefits of having confidence, establishing oneself in remedial pride, the impropriety of afflictive pride, and the benefits of remedial pride.",

These small failings can create significant obstacles on one's path, potentially throwing one into lower realms just like major downfalls would. This leads to discouragement, causing one to abandon the effort to accomplish the two aims, and falling into a state of deprivation. When overcome by such laziness, one's physical and mental engagement deteriorates, making liberation increasingly difficult to attain. Therefore, one should diligently develop the power of remedies to overcome afflictions.",

When one becomes discouraged and abandons the effort to accomplish the two purposes, how can one ever be freed from the state of suffering and poverty? This is because laziness destroys and impairs the functioning of body and mind, making it impossible to overcome afflictions.\n\n**Second verse: 'ང་རྒྱལ་རྩོལ་བ་བསྐྱེད་པས་ནི། །ཆེན་པོ་ཡིས་ཀྱང་ཐུབ་པར་དཀའ། །' (By generating pride and effort, even the great [hindrances] are difficult to overcome [one].)**\n\nHowever, if one does not act this way but instead generates diligence through the pride of great courage—confessing what should be confessed and restraining what should be restrained—then even major downfalls, even root downfalls, become difficult to overcome one; that is, they cannot cast one into lower realms. By generating pride and effort in cultivating the power of antidotes, even major objects of abandonment become difficult to defeat the practitioner. As stated in the Sutra of Skilled Means of the Great Secret: 'Just as a great mantrin, even when bound by five bonds, can be liberated whenever desired, likewise bodhisattvas skilled in the methods of emptiness and compassion cannot be overcome by major downfalls.' Therefore, with a steadfast mind, one should conquer downfalls rather than be conquered by them.",

This steadfastness is the foundation for overcoming negative tendencies.\n\n'I shall defeat all downfalls' means one must utterly vanquish the downfalls or negative actions that are to be abandoned on the spiritual path. This requires generating exertion through pride and diligent application of remedies.\n\n'If I am defeated by downfalls' presents the alternative scenario where one succumbs to negative tendencies rather than overcoming them.\n\n'My wish to conquer the three realms will become a matter of ridicule' explains the consequence of failure: one's aspiration to attain Buddhahood—which involves conquering all that is to be abandoned in the three realms of existence—would become embarrassing and laughable to others. This would undermine one's entire spiritual journey.\n\nThis verse constitutes the third point in this section of the text, emphasizing the importance of mental steadfastness in overcoming obstacles on the path to enlightenment.",

By whom should this pride be maintained? By me, the son of the Victorious Lion who frightens wild beasts such as demons and non-Buddhists. I should maintain this pride, thinking, 'I will not allow any object of abandonment to defeat me.' This is the third point in the text's structure.

This verse refers to someone who maintains the remedial forces with great strength, turning pride itself into a spiritual antidote.\n\nSuch a person is called 'proud' in a positive sense because they have cultivated the counteracting pride—a remedial quality that opposes ordinary afflictive pride. This individual, having thoroughly defeated without remainder the enemy of the 'I am' pride that boasts the power to subjugate the three realms, is rightfully called 'the complete victor over enemies.'\n\nThe final part of the verse explains that this spiritual hero, having definitively conquered even the stirring enemy of prideful affliction through the supreme pride of capability, accomplishes for all sentient beings the perfect fruit of victory—the complete enlightenment or buddhahood—exactly in accordance with their wishes.

This metaphor illustrates that worldly pleasures provide minimal benefit while carrying great risk and danger.\n\nའདོད་པ་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་མི་ངོམས་ན། །\n(If one is not satisfied by desires,)\n\nThis line points out that no matter how much one indulges in sensory desires such as forms, sounds, and other sense pleasures, one is never truly satisfied. Like drinking salt water, the more one indulges in these sense pleasures, the less satisfaction one feels, leading to endless craving. Despite experiencing the momentary happiness of sense objects meeting consciousness, one becomes increasingly attached and fixated, yet never satiated.\n\nརྣམ་སྨིན་བདེ་ལ་ཞི་བ་ཡི། །\n(With the ripening happiness and peace)\n\nThis refers to the practices of the bodhisattva path, such as generosity and moral discipline, which are like nectar—highly beneficial and without risk.

These practices are like nectar - greatly beneficial and harmless - and encompass the accumulations of merit and wisdom that lead to both temporary benefits (the pleasures of higher rebirth as gods and humans) and the ultimate result of nirvana where all suffering is pacified.\n\nThis verse introduces the third power (of joyful engagement) and transitions to the fourth power, the power of relinquishment, which has two aspects: temporary relinquishment and permanent relinquishment.

Similarly, in our inner battle, one should guard oneself against being harmed by the sharp weapons of afflictions ('ཉོན་མོངས་མཚོན་ལས་གཟུར་བྱ་ཞིང་། །'), evading and turning away from them without being overcome, while simultaneously striking at and thoroughly crushing these enemy afflictions ('ཉོན་མོངས་དགྲ་རྣམས་འཇེབས་པར་བཏགས། །'), pulverizing them completely so they find no opportunity to harm us again, effectively uprooting them from their foundation using the weapons of their antidotes.

This illustrates a natural response to immediate danger on the battlefield.\n\nSimilarly, if the weapon of mindfulness is lost—that is, if one forgets the antidote and becomes distracted—one has essentially dropped one's spiritual protection. This loss of mindfulness occurs when one falls under the influence of afflictions and forgets to maintain vigilance over virtuous objects of meditation.\n\nJust as the warrior fears death when disarmed in battle, one should recall the fear of the hell realms that will arise as a consequence of being overcome by afflictions. This recollection serves as a powerful motivator.\n\nTherefore, by remembering the fearsome consequences of the hell realms, one should swiftly take up or rely upon the weapon of mindfulness again, diligently applying the antidote of vigilance. This practice prevents faults from arising and protects one from the dangers of negative states of rebirth.\n\nThis teaching represents the third point in the text's structure, which specifically addresses how to prevent spiritual faults from arising through maintaining constant mindfulness.",

This vividly illustrates how something harmful, once entering a system that can carry it, will inevitably spread to affect the whole.\n\nSimilarly, when afflictions such as the loss of mindfulness find an opportunity or weakness in one's mental guard, even a minor flaw of affliction, having found this weak point in one's mindstream, will gradually spread. Faults such as anger will then pervade the mind completely, just as the poison spreads through the body.\n\nThese mental faults, when allowed to spread, block the life-force of higher rebirth and give rise to greater afflictions. Therefore, one should be vigilant and reverse even the slightest affliction before it finds an opportunity to spread throughout one's consciousness. This requires maintaining constant mindfulness and addressing negative mental states as soon as they arise.",

Just as the oil-carrier maintains perfect focus due to mortal fear, the bodhisattva should maintain vigilance through holding fast to antidotes such as the mind of awakening (bodhicitta) and remain constantly aware of the dangers of the three realms of samsara. This teaching is illustrated by the story of King Fierce Radiance (Caṇḍapradyota) and how he tested Ārya Kātyāyana and his retinue when they arrived in his kingdom.",
    "<7><72> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, when afflictions arise, they can destroy virtue and lead to great harm, even rebirth in the hells. Just as when a woman's hair catches fire, one quickly extinguishes it, or when a venomous snake suddenly appears in one's lap, one rises up very quickly out of extreme fear, similarly, when drowsiness and laziness arise during the evening, dawn, or other times, one should immediately counteract them. Sleep and laziness gather uncontrollably, so one should swiftly dispel them through fear of the consequences, by getting up from bed and engaging in virtuous activity. One must make this commitment and strive diligently. For example, the great translator Rinchen Zangpo demonstrated this level of commitment during his seven-year retreat, making three pledges: In his outer pledge, he stated, 'If even a single afflictive emotion arises in my mindstream, may the ḍākinīs and dharma protectors take my life and heart.' He made similar middle and inner pledges against self-centered intention and thoughts clinging to characteristics. It is said that establishing such firm commitments and determination is extremely important for dispelling these obstacles to spiritual practice.",

Am I still going to act this way?' We must contemplate extensively on how to ensure that such faults will never arise in us again in the future, resolving: 'By all means, I must strive in such a way that this fault will not occur to me again.' This self-examination should be conducted for a long time, not just briefly. Additionally, we should perform complete confession with the four powers to purify these mistakes. Through such thorough self-reproach and genuine resolution, we can effectively prevent similar faults from recurring.",

The verse asks, 'How shall mindfulness become habituated in these states?' indicating the practitioner's concern with developing consistent mindfulness that does not forget virtuous objects.\n\n'Will I develop habituation of mindfulness' points to the cultivation of both mindfulness (dran pa) and awareness (shes bzhin) with diligence. This habituation is essential for maintaining vigilance over one's mental and physical activities.\n\n'With this cause' indicates the motivational basis for seeking spiritual guidance. Using this motivation as a cause, one should desire two things: either 'meeting with spiritual teachers' (specifically virtuous spiritual friends of the Mahāyāna tradition), or engaging in 'reasonable activities' that align with proper instructions.\n\nThe 'appropriate activities' mentioned can be understood as retreat practice, pilgrimage to holy places, receiving advice and teachings from qualified masters, and performing rehabilitative actions to rise from downfalls when one has committed errors. Sherabjung specifically explains 'appropriate activities' as 'instructions received from the master.'\n\nThis verse forms part of the section on bringing oneself under control, which involves making virtuous activity light and nimble through thoroughly training body and mind. Whatever activities one engages in should be pursued as suitable means for developing and increasing mindfulness in one's mindstream.",
    "<7><75> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn order that whatever virtuous actions one undertakes will, from the very beginning, have the power and strength to be fully accomplished, one should contemplate the training to be achieved. By all means, before engaging in virtuous actions, one should develop the power and strength of diligence toward all virtuous deeds. Recalling the previously taught instructions on how to cultivate mindfulness (bag yod) and related topics, one should remember these teachings on mindfulness and vigilance. Then, one should rise to virtuous activities with lightness, meaning one should engage swiftly with great joy and enthusiasm, free from hesitation and reluctance toward virtuous activities. The purpose of this approach is to ensure that one's practice is effective from the outset.",

    "<7><77> Combined Commentary on 'Teaching on Diligence' (Chapter Seven)\n\nThis chapter explains how one should cultivate diligence, which is essential for the bodhisattva path. As stated in the Mindfulness Establishments: 'One foundation of afflictions is laziness. Whoever possesses it lacks all dharmas.' Therefore, one must strive to generate diligence that counteracts laziness.\n\nThe text uses a powerful metaphor: just as the wind moves back and forth, effortlessly controlling cotton with ease, similarly one must swiftly gain mastery over one's body, speech, and mind through joyful engagement in virtue. Through such enthusiasm for virtue, one can control body and speech, ensuring that all virtuous actions of the three gates (body, speech, and mind) will be quickly accomplished.\n\nTo cultivate diligence effectively, one must remove adverse conditions and cultivate the four powers as favorable conditions. The adverse conditions include procrastination (thinking there is still time), attachment to negative activities, and discouragement.\n\nAs an antidote to procrastination, one should contemplate how quickly this body disintegrates, how one falls into lower realms after death, and how difficult it is to obtain the freedoms and advantages of human rebirth.\n\nDiscouragement manifests in three ways: thinking 'I cannot attain the limitless qualities of Buddhahood'; thinking 'I cannot accomplish countless difficult tasks like giving away limbs'; and thinking 'I cannot endure the sufferings of saṃsāra through countless future rebirths.'\n\nTo counteract these forms of discouragement, one should remember that even the Buddhas began from a state similar to ours, progressing step by step until enlightenment. When the time for giving comes, it becomes as easy as giving away food. Furthermore, Bodhisattvas who have abandoned non-virtue do not experience the resulting painful sensations, having realized the emptiness of saṃsāric suffering.\n\nStriving for liberation depends primarily on initial engagement, continuation, and completion. Since these depend on applying diligence with effort, one should generate diligence complete with the four powers.\n\nThrough such diligent practice, one will eagerly engage in virtuous actions, and all endeavors will be brought to completion and properly accomplished.\n\nThis concludes the seventh chapter called 'Teaching on Diligence' from the 'Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Conduct.'"

    "<8><1> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དེ་ལྟར་བརྩོན་འགྲུས་བསྐྱེད་ནས་ནི།' (Having thus generated diligence)\nHaving generated the diligence that takes joy in virtue as explained earlier—through methods of meditation, learning, and contemplation, limiting one's food intake, minimizing sleep, and directing one's awareness with focused attention—one should proceed to the next step. As the Śikṣāsamuccaya states: 'One should cultivate patience and seek learning. Then one should dwell in the forest. One should strive for meditative equipoise, and cultivate meditation on unattractiveness and so forth.'\n\n'ཡིད་ནི་ཏིང་ངེ་འཛིན་ལ་བཞག' (One should place the mind in meditative concentration)\nAfter generating diligence, one should place one's mind in samādhi or meditative concentration, where the mind remains one-pointedly focused on the object of meditation without distraction. This follows naturally from first relying on a spiritual teacher, listening to instructions, contemplating their meaning, and then meditating upon them, as Maitreya stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra.\n\n'སེམས་ནི་རྣམ་པར་གཡེངས་པའི་མི།' (A person whose mind is distracted)\nA person whose mind is distracted by the objects of the six collections of consciousness cannot achieve concentration and fails to progress on the path. Distraction is the enemy of meditation and spiritual progress.\n\n'ཉོན་མོངས་མཆེ་བའི་ཕྲག་ན་གནས།' (Dwells between the fangs of afflictions)\nSuch a distracted person dwells between the fangs of afflictions that, like demons or ferocious wild beasts, quickly destroy them—injuring one's qualities and destroying the life-force of liberation, thus causing suffering. To avoid this fate, one must abandon distraction by isolating body and mind from busyness and discursive thoughts about sense desires, which are antithetical to meditative concentration.",
    "<8><2> Combined Commentary\n\nBy physical isolation (separating oneself from mutual gatherings and interactions) and by mental isolation (abandoning attachment to desires and so forth), when the mind remains free from thoughts concerning the three times, all external and internal distractions will not arise. Through secluding the body and mind in this way, the opposing factors to concentration are eliminated and distraction does not occur.\n\nTherefore, as a method for physical seclusion, one should abandon worldly associations with friends, relatives, and other gatherings that are without essence. If one truly wishes to cultivate concentration, one must dwell alone without companions in a secluded place, as even having just one companion can obstruct meditative concentration.\n\nAs a method for mental seclusion, one should completely discard all conceptual thoughts about objects such as desires and so forth, and cultivate meditative concentration instead. As stated in the sūtra: 'For those whose minds are distracted, even the arising of worldly meditation is rare, let alone unsurpassed awakening. Therefore, until attaining unsurpassed awakening, one should not allow the mind to be distracted.'\n\nThis teaching is presented in two main parts: abandoning worldly concerns, and discarding conceptual thoughts. For if the mind remains distracted, one dwells between the fangs of wild beasts—the afflictions—which can quickly destroy one's spiritual practice.",
    "<8><3> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nDue to attachment to sentient beings internally and the conception of 'mine,' one does not abandon worldly distractions because of craving for external things such as gain, honor, verses, and so forth. \n\nBecause of this inner attachment and external craving, one cannot and is unable to free oneself from worldly entanglements.\n\nTherefore, having completely abandoned these attachments and cravings for both external and internal objects, the learned person who possesses a mind skilled in what to adopt and what to reject should practice in this way.\n\nThe wise person who wishes to abandon afflictive emotions should contemplate and reflect in the manner explained below.\n\nHow should one practice? As stated in the Dharma-saṃgīti-sūtra: 'From a mind resting in equipoise, one will see reality exactly as it is.' Similarly, the Sūtrālaṃkāra teaches: 'Based on proper abiding, for the purpose of placing the mind within the mind itself, and for the purpose of thoroughly discriminating phenomena, there are calm abiding and special insight.'\n\nThus, one should be thoroughly endowed with calm abiding (śamatha) that single-pointedly dwells on the true nature of mind, as this forms the foundation for abandoning attachments and seeing reality as it truly is.",
    "<8><4> Combined Commentary\n\nUnderstanding that heightened insight (vipaśyanā) that is fully endowed with calm abiding (śamatha) completely overcomes and destroys the afflictions along with their seeds and latent predispositions, one should first seek to cultivate calm abiding. Calm abiding is achieved through becoming accustomed to single-pointed concentration on a virtuous object, free from dullness and agitation, where the mind can be sent forth, left alone, or held still at will, and one obtains the special bliss of physical and mental pliancy.\n\nWhen this calm abiding is paired with vipaśyanā—the wisdom that realizes the true nature of phenomena, their suchness or emptiness—these two together can uproot and destroy the afflictions. Having understood this, one should first seek and cultivate śamatha through relying on the nine methods of mental abiding and related practices.\n\nMoreover, this calm abiding concentration, which serves as the necessary foundation or basis for vipaśyanā, is accomplished through genuine delight in meditating in isolated places, free from attachment to worldly concerns—both internal (attachment to sentient beings) and external (attachment to material gains, possessions, and honors). This is because attachment to these things causes one to fall under the power of dullness and agitation, making calm abiding impossible.\n\nThis is the unmistaken sequence for entering the authentic path, as taught by the great masters. As Vasubandhu stated: 'Maintaining proper conduct, endowed with learning and contemplation, one thoroughly engages in meditation.' Without freedom from worldly attachments, one cannot accomplish the calm abiding that is essential for developing liberating insight.",
    "<8><5> Combined Commentary\n\nWho among the impermanent could rightfully cultivate genuine attachment to the impermanent? Since one's own self lacks permanence and stability—being impermanent—and since friends, relatives, and loved ones also lack permanence and stability, it is inappropriate to become attached to them. What impermanent being, who will soon die, should properly become attached to other impermanent things such as friends and relatives? Through such attachment, not just temporarily but even over thousands of lifetimes, one will never experience or obtain even the slightest joy, happiness, or pleasure that is dear to the heart. Due to such attachment, one will never again see one's beloved throughout thousands of future lives as a ripening result, because negative karma produces undesired results. One who becomes attached to the beloved will never see the desired objects of their affection even in thousands of future lives.",
    "<8><6> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf one does not see the attractive object or companion, one does not experience joy or delight. Because of this mental discomfort and disturbance from thinking and analyzing about the desired object, the mind becomes distracted and cannot rest evenly in meditative concentration (samādhi) or equipoise. And even if one does see and meet that attractive companion or object, one will not be satisfied or content with it. Therefore, just as in the earlier state when one had not seen it but desired it, one continues to be tormented by craving and attachment. As stated in the Lalitavistara Sūtra: 'The pleasure of sensual enjoyments, like drinking salt water, never brings satisfaction.'",
    "<8><7> Combined Commentary:\n\nIf one becomes attached and craves for sentient beings, companions and friends, it completely obscures one from seeing reality itself—the true nature of things or ultimate truth. This attachment hinders direct perception of reality. Such craving for contaminated objects destroys any existing mind of weariness toward samsara (renunciation) and prevents such renunciation from arising in the future, thus one cannot attain liberation. Finally, when inevitable separation occurs through death or other circumstances, one's mind becomes intensely tormented by grief and sorrow.",

Instead of accomplishing virtue, one's time is filled only with negativity and suffering.\n\n'རྟག་པ་མེད་པའི་མཛའ་བཤེས་ཀྱིས།' (By impermanent friends) - These impermanent and unstable friends are temporary by nature, as we will soon be separated from them. The text warns against attachment to those who are fleeting and unreliable.\n\n'གཡུང་དྲུང་ཆོས་ཀྱང་འཇིག་པར་འགྱུར།' (Even the eternal Dharma will be destroyed) - Due to attachment to impermanent friends, even the practice of Dharma that leads to attaining the supreme and unchanging state of liberation (gyung drung) will be destroyed. According to Gyelha [Devaśarman], impermanent friends cause the destruction of the Dharma that serves as the cause of liberation, which is liberation itself. Through such attachments, one becomes equal in fortune to childish beings, risking lower rebirths and being led away from noble ones.",

In this context, it primarily refers to the latter two categories, especially ordinary foolish persons who lack wisdom. \n\nIf one engages in activities that align with such childish ones through the three doors of body, speech, and mind—essentially sharing the same fortune or behaving in ways identical to theirs—one will certainly be reborn in the lower realms of existence. These fleeting friendships lack permanence and will cause the deterioration of both one's chance for liberation and one's practice of the holy Dharma.\n\nWhen childish companions lead one in ways incompatible with the fortune of the Noble Ones—meaning they guide one away from the noble lineage characterized by few desires, contentment, and delight in renunciation—they place one in circumstances that ruin both this life and the next. They lead one on paths unequal to those of the noble ones, not following their example but guiding elsewhere.\n\nWhat purpose, then, is there in associating with such childish companions? There is no benefit, as desired aims will not be accomplished, and unwanted consequences will only increase. One cannot benefit them, nor can they benefit oneself. Therefore, one should not associate with such childish beings.",
    "<8><10> Combined Commentary\n\nDue to the unstable and fickle nature of their consciousness, childish people can become friends in a single instant, and after just a brief moment, they can also turn into enemies, even threatening one's life. Even when one directs these companions toward circumstances that should bring joy—such as engaging them in virtuous activities—they often become angry because they dislike it. Alternatively, when one possesses spiritual or worldly prosperity that should make them happy, they instead become angry out of jealousy. If one speaks words that would benefit them, they become angry and use various means to turn away from the very causes of virtue that would benefit themselves. Moreover, if one does not listen to their words, they become angry, potentially causing one to fall into lower rebirths. Thus, these ordinary individuals with their unstable minds are extremely difficult to please or satisfy, no matter what approach one takes.",

Due to the unstable nature of their consciousness, such people can become friendly in one moment and turn into enemies the next just from hearing beneficial Dharma. They might make excuses like 'I don't have time' or 'I cannot do it,' becoming upset at what should be causes for joy.\n\n'བདག་ཀྱང་ཕན་ལས་ཟློག་པར་བྱེད། །' - Moreover, these same people try to dissuade me from practicing the sublime dharma that brings benefit. They create various obstacles by engaging in distracting activities, speaking at length, and using various means to turn me away from virtuous actions that would benefit myself.\n\n'དེ་དག་དག་ནི་མ་མཉན་ན། །' - If I do not listen to their discouraging words and continue on the path of virtue despite their obstacles, they become even more displeased.\n\n'ཁྲོ་བས་ངན་འགྲོར་འགྲོ་བར་འགྱུར། །' - Consequently, because of their anger at being ignored, they accumulate negative karma, which causes them to go to the lower realms after death. Their own hostility toward beneficial teachings becomes the cause of their unfortunate rebirth. Thus, it is truly difficult to please ordinary childish beings who reject what would help them and become angry at those trying to benefit them.",
    "<8><12> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Towards the superior, one feels jealousy' - This line describes how childish persons feel intolerable envy toward those who are higher or more accomplished than themselves. Instead of admiration or inspiration, they respond with jealousy when encountering superiors.\n\n'With equals, one competes' - When childish people encounter those of equal status, they engage in mutual rivalry, competition, and quarreling rather than cooperation. They constantly try to outdo their peers through unhealthy competition.\n\n'Towards the inferior, one exhibits pride' - Regarding those lower than themselves, childish persons display contemptuous disdain, ridicule, and arrogance. They look down on others from a position of unwarranted pride.\n\n'When praised, one becomes arrogant' - If such people receive praise or have their good qualities mentioned, they immediately become haughty and puffed up with excessive pride, raising their heads with arrogance instead of remaining humble.\n\n'When hearing unpleasant words, anger arises' - When their faults are pointed out or they hear anything unpleasant about themselves, childish people react with immediate anger rather than accepting criticism constructively.\n\n'Therefore, when will one ever obtain benefit from associating with the childish?' - This concluding rhetorical question emphasizes that no benefit can ever come from associating with such childish companions. Not only will one fail to gain anything positive, but such association will inevitably lead to negative actions and unwholesome talk that only perpetuates attachment to cyclic existence.",
    "<8><13> Combined Commentary Explanation:\n\nWhen the verse states 'If one associates with the childish,' it warns that if an ordinary person associates with childish companions, unless one is a noble being, not only will one fail to attain any spiritual qualities, but something unwholesome will inevitably arise.\n\n'Self-praise and belittling others' refers to how childish people tend to praise themselves while disparaging others. This stems from their experiencing jealousy toward those higher than themselves, competing with equals, and developing pride toward those lower. When praised, they become arrogant, and when criticized, they become angry.\n\n'And talk that delights in saṃsāra' includes discussions that foster attachment to cyclic existence, such as conversations about defeating enemies, caring for relatives, business and agriculture, kings and local people, talk about horses, cattle and other livestock, as well as discussions about food, clothing, and ornaments.\n\n'Non-virtues will certainly emerge' emphasizes (stated twice for emphasis in the original) that when associating with childish people, various unwholesome things will inevitably arise, including expressions of angry looks and harsh words even in brief encounters.

    "<8><15> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nOne should flee far away from childish friends, relatives, and ordinary people, maintaining distance since they have not acted for one's benefit, nor will one be of benefit to them. As it is said: 'The affection of close relatives is the fan of divine demons; meeting with dear friends cuts off virtuous practice; the treasury of improper speech is the doorway to downfalls.' One should consider these faults of relying on companions, and instead appreciate the qualities of solitude as expressed in: 'In uninhabited, solitary mountain retreats, all conduct becomes virtuous.'\n\nIf one happens to meet relatives and friends in places like mountain hermitages or while going to a village for alms, one should please them temporarily with pleasant conversation and kindness that makes them happy. This is like a bee that takes only nectar without being attached to the color of flowers—one should sustain the body and take only what is necessary for the purpose of practicing Dharma.\n\nOne should not develop excessive familiarity or prolonged connection with them, as this would harm one's practice. Instead, one should remain properly in a neutral state, maintaining good conduct like an ordinary person—neither hostile nor friendly—without attachment or aversion toward them. One should dwell without social familiarity with people, as if one had never seen them before.",
    "<8><16> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Just as a bee extracts honey from flowers without harming their color or fragrance, likewise one should extract only the essential purpose of the Dharma.' This verse draws on the classic metaphor found in the 'Seven Buddhas' Poṣadha for Complete Protection' which states: 'Just as a bee does not harm the color or fragrance of a flower, but extracts its nectar and flies away, so does the sage move through the village.' \n\n'Having taken merely the purpose of Dharma' has two interpretations: First, when visiting villages for alms, offerings, or rituals to sustain oneself, one should obtain only the minimum food and clothing in accordance with Dharma, without becoming attached to benefactors. Second, it refers to extracting only the essential meaning of the Dharma from one's teacher.\n\n'Like never having seen them before' means one should maintain distance and detachment from one's benefactors and social connections. When encountering others, one should respond with appropriate civility but avoid becoming overly familiar or entangled in worldly relationships.\n\n'One should dwell without familiarity' teaches that practitioners should remain unattached and independent, avoiding the common pitfall where 'officiating lamas take possession of their patrons, and patrons take possession of their lamas.' Such entanglements lead to the eight worldly concerns of attachment and aversion, creating negative karma that harms both parties in this life and beyond. As the Omniscient Dharma Lord advised, one should 'avoid both friendship and enmity' and maintain one's own ground, particularly in solitary retreats.",

Due to the faults of conceit and attachment, one will experience various fears and sufferings of the lower realms after death. Those overcome by such pride may collect all possible offerings and property in this life, but this will lead to terrible suffering in the next. One should be mindful of cautionary stories like that of Tsang La Tanagchen and practice with diligence instead.\n\nRegarding the proper use of wealth: arhats use it without attachment, trainees use it as if borrowed, disciplined practitioners use it according to the rules, those with discipline but lacking wisdom use it as a debt, while for those with degenerated discipline, using such wealth is like consuming burning iron.",

For example, if in this life one indulges in stolen goods or consumes a hundred cups of alcohol, in the next life these will be combined together a thousandfold, resulting in intense suffering such as having to drink boiling molten copper.\n\nThe phrase 'rises up' indicates that, like an old bear awakening, the ripening of suffering will arise and be experienced in future lives. Even from what seems like a small cause, a great result can emerge—this demonstrates the inconceivable ripening process of interdependent causation.\n\nFor this reason, those skilled in what to adopt and what to abandon should not become attached to gain and honor, because from such attachment arises the fear of being born in the lower realms.

This reveals the ultimate futility of attachment to worldly acquisitions, as they provide no direction or help at the moment of death. Therefore, it is inappropriate to be excessively pleased by praise or displeased by criticism, as neither has lasting significance.",
    "<8><21> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse teaches us to be indifferent to both praise and criticism. \n\n'If there are others who criticize me, what reason is there for me to be happy when someone praises me?' - This means that since some people will criticize us anyway, becoming attached to praise makes little sense; the criticism from others will obstruct or nullify any pleasure we might derive from praise. Our happiness becomes dependent on the shifting opinions of others.\n\n'If there are others who praise me, what reason is there for me to be unhappy when someone criticizes me?' - Similarly, since some people will praise us regardless, becoming upset over criticism is equally pointless; the praise from others counterbalances the criticism. Our status or true worth doesn't actually change based on others' words.\n\nThe verse ultimately demonstrates that attachment or aversion to praise and criticism is inappropriate, as these are just the subjective opinions of others that often contradict each other. This teaching forms part of the broader discussion on the faults of socializing with ordinary or childish people, as their approval and disapproval are inconsistent and ultimately meaningless for our spiritual development.",

That is, they cannot generate joy without seeking their own self-interest above others and their objectives in this and future lives. Since childish persons pursue only self-interest, they cannot experience genuine altruistic joy.\n\nབྱིས་པ་འགའ་ཡང་བཤེས་མིན་ཞེས། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པ་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་གསུངས། །\n(The Tathagatas have taught that no childish person is a friend)\n\nThis is why the Tathāgatas have explicitly stated, 'No childish person whatsoever should be relied upon as a friend.' As it says in the Sarvatathāgataviṣayāvatāra (Entering the Domain of All Tathāgatas): 'Just as one never experiences joy when dwelling among wild beasts, likewise, by relying on childish people, one will never experience joy.' And the Samādhirāja (King of Concentration) Sūtra states: 'Even if childish people are properly relied upon for a long time, they will later become unfriendly and hostile. Understanding this to be the nature of childish people, the wise never rely on them.'\n\nOne might wonder: 'Doesn't this contradict what was previously explained about Bodhisattvas working solely for the welfare of sentient beings?' It does not. The previous teaching was made in the context of not diminishing oneself while benefiting others, while this teaching addresses the opposite situation. Even if one cannot directly benefit others, performing virtuous deeds with the intention to benefit others does not constitute abandoning their welfare.\n\nThis verse begins the section on the benefits of relying on solitude, which addresses the special qualities of companions, dwelling places, livelihood, discernment, and non-distraction. The teaching emphasizes that learned ones endowed with extensive study should abandon association with childish persons and dwell in the forest to cultivate spiritual qualities.",
    "<8><25> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**'In the forest, wild animals, birds and trees do not speak unpleasant words. When will I dwell together with those pleasant companions?'**\n\nIn this verse, the author describes the special companions found in a secluded forest—a place renowned as the dwelling of hundreds of sages and thousands of accomplished practitioners. These special companions are the various wild animals, birds, and trees that inhabit these natural settings. \n\nUnlike humans, these forest dwellers 'do not speak unpleasant words' (མི་སྙན་རྗོད་མི་བྱེད). They never engage in harmful speech that exaggerates or denigrates, mocks or disparages oneself. These natural companions won't speak harsh or unpleasant words regardless of how long one associates with them, so there's never any need to worry about earning their displeasure.\n\nThe final lines express a heartfelt aspiration: 'When will I dwell together with those pleasant companions?' (ནམ་ཞིག་ལྷན་ཅིག་བདག་གནས་འགྱུར). Here the practitioner contemplates and yearns for the time when they can live among these naturally agreeable companions in the peaceful solitude of the forest. This represents the practitioner's desire to escape the complications of human relationships and dwell in the simplicity and harmony of nature.",
    "<8><26> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ཕུག་གམ་ལྷ་ཁང་སྟོང་པའམ། །' - One should establish residence in a natural cave-dwelling in the rocks or earth, or in an empty temple that is devoid of other people, without claiming ownership of these places.\n\n'ལྗོན་ཤིང་དྲུང་དུ་གནས་བཅས་ཏེ། །' - Alternatively, one may dwell at the foot of a pleasant tree, establishing a dwelling in these naturally spacious places as long as desired, where no one else has claimed ownership.\n\n'ནམ་ཞིག་རྒྱབ་ཏུ་མི་ལྟ་ཞིང་། །' - When will I no longer look behind me (that is, not thinking too much about the future or the past), having no desire to reclaim the homes and possessions that I previously abandoned? This means not extending one's thoughts beyond a short period - at best for a day and night, middling for a month, or at worst, not beyond a year.\n\n'ཆགས་པ་མེད་པར་འགྱུར་ཞིག་གུ། །' - When will I become completely free from attachment to place, body, and enjoyments, dwelling independently and remaining without clinging to either physical surroundings or personal possessions? This represents the aspirational contemplation of one seeking to cultivate non-attachment.",
    "<8><27> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ས་ཕྱོགས་བདག་གིར་བཟུང་མེད་པ། །' (When will I dwell in places that are not claimed as anyone's own)\nThis line expresses the aspiration to dwell in secluded places that are not claimed as anyone's property or possession. These are regions free from disputes over ownership, such as caves, rock dwellings, empty temples, or beneath trees, where one can stay without concerns about territorial claims after having abandoned one's former home.\n\n'རང་བཞིན་གྱིས་ནི་ཡངས་རྣམས་སུ། །' (naturally spacious)\nThis refers to places that are naturally spacious and wide, pleasant to behold. The natural expansiveness of these locations provides a physical environment that supports the inner expansiveness of mind that the practitioner seeks to cultivate.\n\n'རང་དབང་སྤྱོད་ཅིང་' (moving freely)\nThis line describes the freedom to move about independently, coming and going as one pleases without depending on others. This physical freedom mirrors the inner freedom being cultivated, where one can wander freely according to one's own wishes without constraint.\n\n'ཆགས་མེད་པར། །' (without attachment)\nThis refers to dwelling without attachment to one's body, possessions, or surroundings. Having previously renounced homes and belongings, the practitioner aspires to be free from looking back with longing, completely released from possessiveness and clinging.\n\n'ནམ་ཞིག་བདག་ནི་གནས་པར་འགྱུར། །' (When will I become someone who dwells this way?)\nThe verse concludes with a heartfelt aspiration asking when the practitioner might attain this ideal state of dwelling, expressing the deep yearning for this mode of existence that supports spiritual practice.",
    "<8><28> Combined Commentary Explanation of the Verse:\n\n'ལྷུང་བཟེད་ལ་སོགས་ཉི་ཚེ་དང་། །' (When will I possess only a few simple requisites like an alms bowl and the like)\nThis line expresses the aspiration to live with minimal possessions, specifically just a clay or earthen alms bowl and similar basic necessities. These meager resources represent the special qualities of simplicity in one's possessions, showing detachment from material wealth.\n\n'ཀུན་ལ་མི་མཁོའི་གོས་འཆང་ཞིང་། །' (Wearing robes that are of no use to others)\nThis describes wearing the poorest quality robes—garments that thieves and enemies have no interest in, such as felted clothes or those collected from garbage heaps or cremation grounds. These are robes that others do not covet, further reducing attachment to possessions and eliminating fear of theft.\n\n'ལུས་འདི་སྦ་བར་མ་བྱས་ཀྱང་། །' (Without having to hide this body)\nEven without concealing this body in secure places out of fear of enemies or thieves, one aspires to live without anxiety. This line points to freedom from attachment to the body itself, not feeling the need to protect it excessively.\n\n'འཇིགས་མེད་གནས་པར་ནམ་ཞིག་འགྱུར། །' (When will I come to dwell fearlessly?)\nThis final line expresses the ultimate aspiration: When will I be able to dwell alone, without companions, completely free from the fear that enemies and thieves might see me or harm me? This represents the practitioner's longing for a state of fearlessness that comes from non-attachment to both possessions and body.\n\nThis verse forms part of the analytical contemplation of the antidote to attachment to the body, and one should repeatedly aspire to this ideal while putting it into practice through actual application.",
    "<8><29> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དུར་ཁྲོད་སོང་ནས་' (Having gone to the charnel ground) - When engaged in this contemplative practice, one should physically go to a charnel ground where corpses and skeletal remains are visible. This creates a direct confrontation with mortality, even if one is not an actual charnel ground dweller.\n\n'གཞན་དག་གི། །རུས་གོང་དག་དང་' (The skeletal remains of others) - Upon seeing the corpses and skeletons of others—both fresh and old, quickly decomposing—one should observe these remains carefully. Looking at the bluish, decomposing corpses, one should reflect: 'These were once people like myself who cherished their bodies and could not tolerate heat, cold, or illness.'\n\n'བདག་གི་ལུས། །' (And my body) - Then, one should contemplate one's own currently living and cherished body that cannot tolerate discomfort, recognizing that 'Previously it was of this nature, currently it is of this nature, and in the future it will not transcend this characteristic.'\n\n'འཇིག་བའི་ཆོས་ཅན་དག་ཏུ་ནི། །' (Are alike in being subject to destruction) - One must recognize that both one's own body and these remains share the exact same nature—they are equally subject to decay and destruction. This is generating the perception of the body as ultimately a lifeless object, as taught in the Perfection of Wisdom literature.\n\n'ནམ་ཞིག་མགོ་སྙོམས་བྱེད་པར་འགྱུར། །' (When will I equalize them?) - This final line expresses an aspiration: 'When will I truly internalize this understanding that my body and others' remains are fundamentally equal?' This aspiration aims at overcoming attachment to self and others, which is a cause for not taking delight in solitude. The verse represents a profound wish to fully realize the impermanent nature of one's own physical form.",
    "<8><30> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'This very body of mine' refers to our current physical form which now appears alive and well, but will eventually undergo transformation after death. \n\nWhen this body 'becomes rotten and putrid' following death, its decomposition will create an extremely foul odor that becomes unbearable.\n\nThe line about 'even jackals' is significant because these animals normally seek out and consume impure flesh and decaying matter, yet even they will be repelled by the intense stench of our decomposed bodies.\n\n'Would not approach near it' emphasizes how utterly repulsive our bodies will become—creatures that normally feed on carrion will avoid our remains due to their extreme foulness, let alone other beings with more refined senses.\n\n'Will become such' reminds us that this transformation is inevitable and certain to occur—our bodies will absolutely reach this state of decay.\n\nThis verse serves as a meditation on impermanence and impurity, encouraging us to contemplate the selflessness of our physical condition and recognize that the body is not a worthy object of attachment. One should equalize oneself with corpses in charnel grounds, reflecting that this condition will inevitably come to pass within a short time.",
    "<8><31> Combined Commentary:\n\nEven this single body of ours, which has arisen from a mother's womb, has flesh, bones, and other parts that were born together from the beginning. \n\nYet ultimately, when one dies, these components that were once inseparable will deteriorate, and the flesh and bones will separate and disperse in different directions. \n\nIf such intimate parts of our own body—which were born together and have been united since the beginning—inevitably separate, what need is there to mention that we will certainly separate from other friends, relatives, and loved ones who have come together merely due to the power of separate karmic conditions?\n\nThis verse serves as a contemplation on the inevitable separation that follows all gatherings, teaching us to abandon craving for permanent connection with friends and loved ones. One should deeply reflect on how separation will quickly and inevitably occur, both from one's own body and from others with whom we share temporary relationships.",
    "<8><32> Combined Commentary\n\n'When first being born, one is born alone' emphasizes the fundamental solitude that marks our entry into this world; no one accompanies us at the moment of birth. 'And when dying, one also dies alone' reinforces this existential truth that at the end of life, just as at its beginning, we face our fate in absolute solitude. 'Since others do not take on one's share of suffering' points to the inescapable reality that our karmic burdens and their resulting suffering cannot be transferred to others—neither relatives nor friends can take on our share of suffering from birth, death, or the ripening of negative karma. 'What purpose do relatives and friends serve who create obstacles to virtuous activities?' questions the value of relationships that hinder our spiritual growth, particularly when these companions cannot help us with our most fundamental existential challenges. The verse concludes that such relationships that obstruct virtue 'are of no use' and provide 'not even the slightest benefit,' making attachment to them inappropriate, as they 'cannot be of help' with the most essential matters of our existence.",
    "<8><33> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as travelers who have set out on long roads successively abandon one dwelling place and take up another, such as inns and the like, in the same way, those who have entered the path of existence—the cycle of the three realms of saṃsāra—also fully grasp and become attached to the current dwelling place of human birth.\n\nSimilar to how journeying travelers stay only briefly in a single dwelling place for one night, likewise those who, through the power of karma, have entered the path of existence merely take hold of a birthplace in one class, one lineage relationship and so forth, being born in a single birthplace.\n\nThough beings have no desire to leave their current birth-state, when the time comes, the Lord of Death, Yama, arrives swiftly and, against their wishes, powerlessly leads them to the next life.\n\nThus, neither body nor relatives can be determined as truly one's own, for just as travelers abandon one lodging and take up another, those who have embarked on the path of existence also abandon one place of birth and fully take up another.\n\nTherefore, it is not reasonable to become attached to one's current birth state, body, or relatives—this understanding represents the reason why the wise should rely on solitude rather than worldly attachments.",
    "<8><34> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འཇིག་རྟེན་ཀུན་ནས་གདུང་བཞིན་དུ། །' (As the world is tormented with grief from all sides)\nThis line describes how family, friends, and other worldly people are afflicted with grief from all sides at the time of death—tearing their hair, filling their eyes with tears, and crying out in lamentation such as 'Alas, father! Alas, mother!' Since birth inevitably ends in death, this verse addresses the universal suffering that accompanies the death of a loved one.\n\n'ཇི་སྲིད་སྐྱེས་བུ་བཞི་ཡིས་ནི། །' (As long as the four men)\nThis refers to the four pallbearers who traditionally carry the deceased's body. The Teaching to the King emphasizes that during this time of widespread grief, these four men are tasked with a solemn duty.\n\n'དེ་ལས་ལུས་དེ་ནི་མ་བཏེག་པ། །' (Have not lifted that body from that place)\nThis line indicates the specific moment in time—before the corpse has been lifted from its place in the home and placed on a bier to be carried to the charnel or cremation ground. This marks a critical transition point in the death process.\n\n'དེ་སྲིད་དུ་ནི་ནགས་སུ་སོང་། །' (Until then, go to the forest)\nThe instruction here is to go to the solitary forest and resort to solitude. The purpose, as suggested in the commentaries, is to strive in virtuous dharma practices in preparation for one's own death, to avoid being afflicted by grief, and to enhance virtuous qualities. This represents the beginning of explaining the benefits of dwelling in the forest, which will be elaborated in subsequent verses.",
    "<8><35> Combined Commentary:\n\nHaving gone to a secluded hermitage, one should make oneself free from friends who cause attachment and enemies who provoke anger, dwelling alone with just this body in solitude. Having abandoned close companions and cut off hope, one should consider oneself as already dead even before actual death. Since relatives and others will regard one as if already dead, when one eventually dies, there will be no one to grieve, wailing and crying out in lamentation. Being free from attachment and all worldly connections, one's passing causes no sorrow to others.",
    "<8><36> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen dwelling in a mountain hermitage or forest retreat, there are no attendants or companions—whether Dharma friends, enemies, or others—standing nearby who would cause sorrow or harm through their grieving. Since no one is present who would mourn or wail when one dies, one experiences no mental discomfort upon seeing others in distress. Furthermore, when dying in such a secluded place, no one will distract or disturb one's practice of virtuous activities such as the recollection of the Buddha, Dharma, and other meditations on the path to liberation and omniscience. Therefore, one will be able to depart peacefully while maintaining a virtuous state of mind. As a sutra states: 'Through properly practicing the holy life and thoroughly training in good actions, at the time of death, there is no sorrow—like being liberated from a burning house.' Having understood these qualities of solitude, the wise should abandon crowds and establish themselves in forest dwelling.",
    "<8><37> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, I should dwell alone in a very beautiful and pleasing forest that is vibrant and attractive to the senses. Such a forest is easily accessible with little effort since livelihood is readily obtained there. It brings both physical comfort and profound mental happiness without the social obligations of greeting others, respecting those of high status, or caring for those of lower status. By merely dwelling in such solitude, through its blessing, all distractions of the three doors (body, speech, and mind) will naturally be pacified. I should remain by myself in such a place because this minimizes harm and increases virtue.\n\nThis verse belongs to the second section on abandoning mistaken conceptualizations, which has two parts: (1) cultivating weariness toward sense desires, and (2) cultivating delight in solitude. The first of these has three parts: (i) contemplating that indulging in desires yields fearful results, (ii) contemplating the impure nature of the body and so forth, and (iii) contemplating that desires give rise to many unwanted consequences. The current verse explains the benefits of solitary forest dwelling as a remedy to the distractions of worldly life.",
    "<8><38> Combined Commentary\n\nHaving abandoned all other thoughts such as subduing enemies, protecting allies, accumulating wealth, seeking gains, desire, ill-will, and other non-virtuous and morally neutral conceptual thoughts that pursue worldly aims of this life, one should focus single-pointedly. As it is said: 'One should not investigate the confusion of others, or what others have or have not done; rather, one should correctly examine oneself for balance and imbalance.' With single-pointed attention focused solely on examining my own mind and cultivating the two aspects of bodhicitta, thinking 'I must tame this very mind,' I will strive diligently. This effort is for two purposes: to place the mind in meditative equipoise through śamatha (calm abiding), and to discipline it through vipaśyanā (special insight), thereby practicing the profound meditation of their union. As stated in the Sūtra Requested by the Householder Ugraparipṛcchā: 'Furthermore, householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in solitude should reflect thus: 'For what purpose do I dwell in solitude? Merely dwelling in solitude does not make one a śramaṇa...' up to '...I should investigate thus: Having dwelt in solitude, I should accomplish the purpose of a śramaṇa completely.'' The second part has two sections: generating weariness toward desire, and cultivating delight in solitude.",
    "<8><39> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n**'In this world and the beyond,  \nDesires produce calamities.  \nHere, they cause killing, binding, and severing;  \nBeyond, they bring about hell and so forth.'**\n\nThis verse addresses the harmful consequences of sensual desires in both present and future lives. Although this teaching connects to the broader theme of abandoning conceptual elaboration found throughout the treatise, here the focus specifically shifts to the antidote to desire (having previously addressed patience as the antidote to anger and wisdom as the antidote to ignorance).\n\n'In this world' refers to our present life, while 'the beyond' indicates future lives. 'Desires' here encompasses both internal objects (such as attraction to other people) and external objects (such as material possessions and gains). These desires 'produce calamities' or 'tremendous misfortune' - they lead to various forms of destruction and suffering.\n\nIn 'this' present life, one may be 'killed' by others out of jealousy or competition for desired objects, 'bound' with iron fetters or imprisoned, and have one's limbs 'severed' with weapons. As one text states: 'What was done with joy will be experienced with tears.' The servants of desire face being 'cut open and carved up; their heads, eyes, arms, and legs are severed and extracted,' as described in the 'Prophecy of the Girl Candrottarā.'\n\nThen 'in the beyond' - in future lives - excessive attachment to desires 'brings about' rebirth in 'hell' realms, as hungry ghosts, animals, 'and so forth,' causing countless unbearable sufferings. The Lalitavistara affirms this, stating: 'I understand all the faults of desire without exception; they are the root of strife, enmity, sorrow, and suffering. They are terrifying like poisonous leaves, like fire, and like the edge of a sword.'\n\nThis verse begins the larger section on abandoning craving for both internal objects (like attraction to others) and external objects (like material gains), which will be followed by teachings on the qualities of solitude.",
    "<8><40> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**ཕོ་ཉ་ཕོ་ཉ་མོ་ཡིས་སྔོན།** - In the past, through both male messengers and female messengers...\n\n**གང་ཕྱིར་དུ་མར་གསོལ་བཏབ་ཅིང་།** - For the sake of which woman one repeatedly made numerous requests with joined palms, saying 'Please arrange for me to stay together with such-and-such a person,' beseeching these messengers in many ways.\n\n**སྡིག་པ་རྣམས་སམ་གྲགས་མིན་ལའང་།** - Regarding sins such as killing one's parents and other serious negative actions that cause harm in future lives, or breaking vows and commitments; as well as regarding ill repute that spreads throughout all directions in this life, causing one to be mocked and criticized by others.\n\n**གང་གི་དོན་དུ་མ་འཛེམས་པར།** - For the sake of which woman, one did not hesitate or show any restraint, deliberately ignored the consequences, exposed oneself to various dangers, and even exhausted one's resources, all without any hesitation or concern.",
    "<8><41> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nEven though one enters into great dangers—such as suffering in this life and the next, including being killed by others or burned in hell-fires—all for the sake of certain women, disregarding harmful actions and ill repute without hesitation.\n\nAnd one's possessions, including food, clothing, ornaments, and various other items, are completely exhausted—whether spent on offerings to the Three Jewels or, more commonly, depleted by giving them to women to place in their mouths, to wear on their backs, and to adorn their bodies.\n\nThose very female bodies that one passionately embraces with great attachment, thinking one's desires are fulfilled and from which one experiences supreme joy in one's mind, are nothing but skeletons wrapped in flesh.\n\nFrom the beginning, these objects of desire were neither under one's control nor truly one's own. As stated in the Mindfulness Establishments (Smṛtyupasthāna): 'Women cause ruin; they ruin this world and the next. If you desire benefit for yourself, therefore completely abandon women.' When they are neither under one's control nor established as self, why does one, intensely desiring them and completely attached to them, not proceed instead to nirvana?",
    "<8><42> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ཀེང་རུས་ཉིད་ཡིན་གཞན་མིན་ན། །' - Upon careful analysis, the body of a woman which one embraces and subsequently becomes attached to is itself merely a skeleton composed of three hundred and sixty connected bones, not anything else that is desirable or pleasing. As stated in the Smṛtyupasthāna (Mindfulness Foundation), these objects who supposedly become a source of supreme joy are nothing but skeletons.\n\n'རང་དབང་དང་ནི་བདག་མིན་ལ། །' - Moreover, this skeleton, being merely imputed in dependence upon an aggregation, lacks independence and is not under one's control. Without independence, there is no truly established self of the person—it is neither something that can be completely grasped as a self nor something that inherently belongs to oneself.\n\n'རབ་ཏུ་འདོད་ཅིང་ཡོངས་ཞེན་ནས། །' - Despite understanding this nature, one intensely desires and becomes thoroughly attached to women, having entered into mortal dangers and exhausted resources in pursuit of this attachment.\n\n'ཅི་ཕྱིར་མྱ་ངན་འདས་མི་འགྲོ། །' - Given these truths, why not proceed to the state of nirvana rather than remaining attached? Without abandoning this craving, it obstructs the path of the three trainings, preventing the attainment of nirvana. As the Smṛtyupasthāna states: 'Women cause ruin; they bring ruin in this world and the next. If you wish to benefit yourself, therefore completely abandon women.' According to the Great Commentary, this verse refers specifically to attachment to one's wife, presenting a clear choice: if you desire nirvana, you must abandon such craving.",
    "<8><43> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThat woman who, at first when new to intimacy, though her face is lifted up with effort and drawn forth, looks downward out of shyness. Here the verse describes how when one initially wishes to look at a woman's face and makes an effort to lift it up or draw it forward, she looks down due to modesty.\n\nWhether that face was previously seen or not seen by others before marriage - referring to whether her face was visible or not during the wedding ceremony according to the customs of noble families in the central regions.\n\nHer face becomes covered with cloth. This refers to how, according to the customs of conquered territories, a bride's face is typically covered with a veil or similar cloth. The commentary also extends this meaning to foreshadow how this same face will later be covered when taken to the charnel ground after death.\n\nThe deeper message implied across the commentaries is about attachment to physical beauty - the same face that one is so eager to see and becomes attached to during life will eventually be carried to the cremation ground, where the coverings will be removed not by lovers but by vultures. This presents a stark contrast meant to challenge one's attachment to physical appearance.",
    "<8><44> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse is addressing how one's attitude toward a desired face changes dramatically after death. \n\n'That face of yours which was afflicted by passion' refers to the face of a woman that you previously desired intensely and were disturbed by passion for. When the relationship was new, despite your efforts to raise her face, she would look downward shyly. During life, her face might have been modestly covered, especially when near charnel grounds.\n\n'Just as it is now directly manifest' means that this same face is now plainly visible in its true nature at the charnel ground after death, stripped of all concealing elements.\n\n'Having seen it exposed by vultures' indicates how the birds have torn away her clothes and flesh, revealing with perfect clarity the very same face you were once attached to. The vultures have laid bare what was previously the object of desire.\n\n'Why are you now fleeing in fear?' challenges the inconsistency of your behavior - previously you eagerly sought this face, but now you run away from it in terror. If you truly desired it before, it would be logical to desire it now as well, yet you flee. This highlights the third point in the teaching: it is inappropriate to guard the body out of jealousy or possessiveness, as this demonstrates the illusory nature of physical attraction.",
    "<8><45> Combined Commentary:\n\n'Even when other men look at a woman with their eyes, you jealously guard her completely.' This line refers to how possessive people become about those they consider 'theirs,' particularly in relationships, guarding against even the mere gaze of others.\n\n'That body which was completely protected by you' refers to the person or body that one jealously guarded and protected out of attachment and possessiveness during life.\n\n'When that body is being devoured by vultures and the like' points to what happens after death, when the body is consumed by scavengers or decomposes naturally.\n\n'Why don't you, the possessive one, also protect her from the vultures?' This rhetorical question challenges the inconsistency in our attachment - we are possessive when convenient but abandon this possessiveness when circumstances change. If the body was truly 'yours' to protect from others' gazes, why not protect it from being consumed after death?\n\nThis verse represents the fourth point in the larger argument: it is not appropriate to worship or be overly attached to the physical body with such reverence and possessiveness, as this attachment is ultimately inconsistent and illogical.",
    "<8><46> Combined Commentary:\n\nSeeing this heap of flesh in the charnel ground, which vultures and others such as jackals and foxes devour as food, those with deluded minds and desires mistakenly perceive it as a pure and attractive object of attachment. But why would you worship and honor another's food—that which belongs to scavengers—with garlands of flowers, sandalwood ointment, and precious ornaments like gold bracelets? It is entirely inappropriate to adorn with such offerings what is ultimately just food for other creatures. This body is not worthy of decoration even while alive. The fifth verse that follows will further explain why it is inappropriate to touch this body with passion.",
    "<8><47> Combined Commentary:\n\nWhen in the cremation ground or charnel ground, upon seeing a terrifying skeleton composed of skull and other bones, you become frightened even though it is completely motionless—unable to walk, sit, or otherwise stir. If you are frightened by such an immobile object, then how much more should you fear when this very same heap of bones is animated and moved about? Just like a vetāla (a reanimated corpse), this skeleton is agitated up and down by internal forces—the demons of wind, mind, and afflictions, or various motivating thoughts. While alive, when the body is moved by such internal motivations, why would you not be even more afraid? Having contemplated thus, it is appropriate to be frightened of the body as you would be of a vetāla, but it is entirely inappropriate to embrace it with attachment. This constitutes the sixth point in the meditation on the unattractiveness of the body.",
    "<8><48> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf you are attached to this body even when it is covered with clothes and ornaments, then why would you not desire it when it is uncovered, such as when it is cast aside in a charnel ground? Logically, you should still desire it then too, as it is the same entity.\n\nIf you argue that 'there is no purpose in the uncovered body since it is of an impure nature,' then why do you embrace the body when it is covered with clothes and ornaments? It is not appropriate to embrace it in either state, as both the covered and uncovered body are equally impure in nature.\n\nThis section forms part of a broader refutation of attachment to the body, demonstrating the unreasonableness of being attached to something when its impurity can be directly perceived. The argument reveals the contradiction in finding a covered body attractive while finding the same body repulsive when uncovered.\n\nThe text is structured to methodically dismantle attachment through several progressive analyses: first addressing the unreasonableness of attachment to tactile sensations, then refuting the conception of purity, examining how neither body nor mind separately provides a valid basis for attachment, encouraging self-reflection by applying these faults to oneself, and finally demonstrating that physical form itself is not a proper basis for attachment.\n\nThis particular passage specifically addresses the first point in this analytical progression, highlighting the inconsistency in our discriminating attitudes toward the same object under different conditions.",
    "<8><49> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ཟས་ནི་གཅིག་པུ་ཉིད་ལས་ནི། །' (From a single source of food)\nFrom the singular source that is food, various substances are produced in the body. This verse establishes the common origin point for the substances that will be compared.\n\n'བཤང་དང་ཁ་ཆུ་བྱུང་གྱུར་ན། །' (When both feces and saliva emerge)\nWhen both excrement, urine, and saliva emerge from this same undifferentiated source—they are all products of the food we consume. They share an identical origin, being transformed within the same body.\n\n'དེ་ལས་བཤང་ལ་མི་དགའ་ཞིང་། །' (Of these, while you dislike feces)\nOf these substances that share the same origin, you find excrement disgusting and are repulsed by it. You naturally dislike and avoid it, considering it impure and unclean.\n\n'ཁ་ཆུ་ལ་ཁྱོད་ཅི་ཕྱིར་དགའ། །' (Why do you delight in saliva?)\nYet paradoxically, you who are deluded by desire enjoy and take pleasure in a woman's saliva as if it were honey. Why do you delight in saliva when both substances are equal in having an impure origin and being impure results? There is no rational basis for this distinction, since both emerge from the same food through the same bodily processes. If one argues 'I enjoy the smooth texture of saliva,' this reasoning is still fundamentally flawed, as it ignores the identical impure nature of both substances.",
    "<8><50> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse speaks to those who are filled with desire and are deluded about the impurity of the female body. Instead of taking pleasure in cotton pillows that are soft and pleasant to touch, the lustful person rejects such comforts in favor of a woman's body. Those overcome by desire are confused about what is truly impure, mistakenly viewing the impure female body as pure. They become attached to it, falsely claiming 'it does not ooze with foul smell' when in reality the body continues to emit impurities. This delusion causes them to prefer physical contact with women over the innocent softness of cotton pillows, failing to recognize the fundamental impurity of what they desire. The verse challenges such people, questioning why they would become so deluded as to reject something genuinely pleasant and clean while embracing that which is actually unclean.",

These individuals, who are blinded by their desire and confused by their grasping at false notions of purity, touch cotton and recognize its softness. However, they become angry at the cotton, saying, 'One cannot have sexual intercourse with this cotton, despite its softness.' This reaction reveals that they are not actually attached to the pleasant tactile sensation of softness itself, but rather to impurity and mistaken notions about sexual objects. Their anger at cotton demonstrates the irrationality of their desires—they reject something with a pleasant tactile quality simply because it cannot satisfy their specific lustful cravings. This illustrates why attachment to tactile sensations is inappropriate and misguided, as such attachment is really rooted in confused mental projections rather than in the sensations themselves.",

    "<8><54> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'You say 'I like this flesh,' expressing your attachment to the physical body, and you desire to touch and look at it. If so, why then do you not desire dead flesh or a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, which is also by nature without consciousness? This flesh too you should logically desire to touch and look at. The fact that you don't desire a corpse demonstrates the inconsistency in your attraction. If you claim 'I don't desire that because it lacks consciousness,' or that you are actually attracted to the woman's mind rather than merely her flesh, then your initial claim about liking the flesh itself is contradicted. Since you do not act in a way that's consistent with desiring all flesh equally, it is improper to be attached to the living body while rejecting dead flesh, as both are ultimately just flesh without inherent consciousness.'",

It is neither a tangible object nor a form, making it impossible to physically interact with. Whatever can be touched and seen—such as another person's body—is not the consciousness or mind that you claim to desire. There is a fundamental mismatch between what you think you desire (the other's mind) and what you actually engage with (their physical form). Therefore, what purpose does this meaningless embracing of the body serve? This attachment to physical form brings not the slightest benefit and is nothing but complete delusion, making such attachment entirely inappropriate.",
    "<8><56> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse discusses our failure to recognize impurity in bodies. That one does not recognize another's body (particularly a woman's body) as impure is not so surprising, especially since it is composed of many impure substances that are hidden from direct view. However, what is truly astonishing—and worthy of ridicule—is that one fails to recognize one's own body as being impure, despite it being directly perceptible to oneself and constantly oozing impurities. This demonstrates an extreme form of delusion. Having recognized this impurity in one's own body, one should refrain from attachment to both one's own body and others' bodies. If one objects saying, 'But I am attracted to women because of their complexion' or 'Although the body has aspects of impurity, I am attached to it because of its excellent color, shape, taste, and tactile qualities,' the subsequent verses will address these objections. This is the fifth point in the progression of the text's argument.",
    "<8><57> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThus, forsaking attachment to the beautiful and pleasing young lotus flower that has blossomed and opened by the rays of the sun at a time when it is free from clouds, why should one's mind, which is attached and clings to impurity, delight in the body, which serves as a container or vessel filled with many impurities? If these attributes of beauty existed in a young lotus that has been opened by the sun's rays free from clouds, then having abandoned that lotus, why should one, with a mind attached to impurity, delight in a cage of impurity? Since it is not reasonable to delight in or be attached to it, it is also not proper to be attached to bodily form.\n\nThis section can be divided into several parts. The second section has either three parts (cause and effect, function, and determining impurity through examples) or four parts (contemplating impurity because it is the source of impurity; contemplating impurity because it is the result of impurity; demonstrating the impurity of the body through examples; and contemplating one's own body as impure). Particularly, this verse addresses how the body is the cause of impurity, presenting the actual explanation and criticism of attachment to it.",
    "<8><58> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse is addressing the inherent impurity of the body, particularly the female body, from a logical perspective. 'If you do not wish to touch places that have been contaminated by impure substances such as feces, urine, vomit and the like'—referring to the 'ground' or 'places' mentioned in the first line that are defiled by such substances—then it is logically inconsistent to desire contact with the very source of these impurities. The third line establishes a causal relationship, pointing out that these impurities originate from the body itself. The final rhetorical question challenges the reader: 'how can you desire to touch a woman's body, which is the cause of impurity, from which those impure substances have emerged?' This creates a logical contradiction between avoiding the products of bodily impurity while desiring the body that produces them. The verse serves to demonstrate that the body itself is 'impure in terms of cause, effect, and the nature of both cause and effect,' making desire for physical contact unreasonable from this perspective.",
    "<8><59> Combined Commentary:\n\nIf you claim to have no attachment to impurity, why then do you embrace another's body in your lap? This verse questions the inconsistency in one's attitude. The woman's body that you desire has arisen from the impure field of the mother's womb, and has been produced and developed by impure substances—namely, the father and mother's semen and blood that served as its seed. Just as you would not wish to touch impure things like feces and urine, it is equally unreasonable to develop attachment to and embrace a body that is fundamentally impure in its origin, development, and constitution. The verse challenges you to recognize that this body you desire is merely the impure result that has emerged from impurity, nourished by the food consumed by the mother and other impure substances. It is therefore not appropriate to embrace such a body with passion.",
    "<8><60> Combined Commentary Explanation:\n\nThis verse pertains to both cause and effect of impurity. The text states 'you do not desire even small impure worms that arise from impurities' such as feces and urine. This highlights how naturally we reject even tiny creatures born from filth.\n\nIn contrast, the verse then questions: 'why do you desire the body, which is by nature composed of many impurities' such as flesh, blood, feces, urine, and so on? The body itself is composed of thirty-six kinds of impure substances.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the contradiction in human behavior—we find small impure worms repulsive, yet we desire the human body which is 'born from impure substances' and is essentially an aggregate of impurities.\n\nNot only do we fail to disparage our own impurity, but we also desire another's body, effectively craving what is merely a 'sack of impurity.' This inconsistency in our attitudes toward impurity is highlighted as inappropriate and illogical.\n\nThe teaching forms part of a broader contemplation on viewing the body as impure, which leads to the logical conclusion that if one is attached to a living body, one should, by the same reasoning, also be attached to a corpse in a charnel ground—obviously an absurd position.",
    "<8><61> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse criticizes our distorted relationship with the body. You, who are attached to perversions, not only do not reproach or feel revulsion for your own body, which is by nature impure, but moreover, you—an impure receptacle yourself—with attachment and craving for impurity, also desire other impure receptacles, namely women's bodies. Not even the small impure worms that arise from impurity desire you. How then could you desire a body born of the nature of many impurities, composed of thirty-six impure substances? Not only do you fail to criticize yourself for being impure, but you, a sack of impurity, out of greed for impurity, also desire others who are impure. You covet other 'bags of impurity' filled with the same substances as your own body. This is extremely blameworthy and inappropriate, highlighting the irrationality of attachment to the physical form. This contemplation of the body as impure serves as the first part of a broader argument that will later suggest that if one is attached to the living body, one should logically be equally attached to corpses in charnel grounds.",
    "<8><62> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nEven pleasant substances like camphor, saffron, sugar, and molasses - which are naturally pure and appealing to the senses - become impure once they interact with our body. Similarly, clean foods such as cooked rice or delicious fragrant vegetable dishes, when placed in the mouth and then taken out again and discarded, cause even clean ground to become impure and defiled. This transformation from clean to unclean demonstrates how the body contaminates whatever it contacts. If even the ground becomes polluted by these substances after they've merely touched our mouth, what need is there to mention the impurity of the body itself that causes this contamination? Therefore, one should not develop attachment to these substances or to the body. This illustrates the inherently impure nature of the body and how it transforms even clean substances into sources of impurity.",
    "<8><63> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf you still have doubts about whether this kind of body, which is manifestly impure by nature, is actually impure or not—even though its impurity is directly perceptible to your senses—then you should go and look at other impure bodies that have been discarded in cremation grounds or charnel grounds. There you will see corpses in various states of decay, being consumed by worms, displaying the unmistakable and disgusting nature of the physical body. Through observing these discarded remains, the truth about the body's impure nature becomes undeniable through the direct perception of cause and effect.",
    "<8><64> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen the skin of a body (or a woman's corpse in a charnel ground) is opened and peeled away, one sees blood, internal organs, feces, and other foul-smelling, nauseating things, which generates great fear in whoever witnesses it. Yet despite knowing this horrific reality, how is it that one not only fails to be afraid of that very body, but moreover repeatedly develops insatiable desire and attachment for it? Such a reaction is completely unreasonable.\n\nTherefore, one should abandon attachment by contemplating that bodies are essentially like corpses in a charnel ground. Having observed and analyzed in this way, we understand that the body's true nature is an appropriate object of revulsion rather than desire.\n\nThe text continues with three parts: (1) showing how artificial ornaments cannot make the body pure; (2) demonstrating that the body does not transcend its nature of impermanence; and (3) contemplating the body as an object of revulsion. Some might argue, 'Although the body is impure, it is reasonable to desire it when it is anointed with pleasant fragrances such as sandalwood and so forth.' However, this merely addresses qualities attributed to the body by other things, not its inherent nature.",
    "<8><65> Combined Commentary\n\nThe fragrance applied to the body, which seems agreeable and attractive, actually comes from sandalwood, camphor, musk, and similar substances - it is not the natural fragrance of the body itself. This pleasant scent that you perceive has no inherent connection to the person's body. So why do you become attached to others' bodies because of fragrances that actually belong to completely different things? It is not reasonable to develop attachment based on a borrowed quality. If you considered that the body's natural odor is actually foul, wouldn't it be better to avoid attachment to it, especially since such attachment leads to numerous forms of suffering?",
    "<8><66> Combined Commentary\n\nGiven the naturally foul-smelling nature of the body, wouldn't it be better not to be attached to it? Indeed, it would be very good to remain unattached, since attachment to the body causes many forms of suffering. The scent applied to the body comes from external substances like camphor, sandalwood, and the like—not from the body itself. So why become attached to someone's body due to an unrelated external fragrance? \n\nThe second point addresses why worldly people with meaningless cravings anoint the body with pleasant scents like sandalwood for the purpose of generating attachment. If the pleasant fragrance is a quality of the sandalwood, what fragrant quality has the body itself gained? None whatsoever. Therefore, it is unreasonable to become attached to one thing because of another's fragrance. It is not appropriate to apply such scents, as they merely mask the body's inherent impurity.",
    "<8><67> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse addresses the issue of fragrance and attraction. Even if pleasant fragrances like sandalwood are applied to the body, we must examine this more deeply. If the pleasant fragrance truly belongs to sandalwood and similar substances, then what inherent pleasant smell actually arises from the human body itself? In reality, nothing pleasant naturally arises from the body, which inherently has an unpleasant, impure smell. \n\nTherefore, why does one become attached to other impure, foul-smelling bodies merely due to the fragrance of external substances like sandalwood? Those in the world who crave meaningless things apply pleasant fragrances to the body specifically to generate attachment, but this is unreasonable. Since the pleasant quality belongs entirely to the sandalwood and not to the body at all, it is improper and illogical to become attached to others through a scent that belongs to something else entirely.",
    "<8><68> Combined Commentary:\n\nIf we examine what happens when a person's body is left completely ungroomed: the hair grows long and hangs down unkempt, the nails become excessively elongated, and the teeth turn grayish-black, bluish-black, or yellowish-discolored with accumulated grime that produces an unpleasant odor. Additionally, the body becomes impregnated with foul-smelling, putrid filth comparable to muddy stench. In such a natural state, the naked body appears truly terrifying, resembling a demon or rakshasa, and becomes extremely repulsive to behold. Therefore, this verse questions why we make such tremendous efforts to clean, groom, and beautify this body when its natural unadorned state is so frightening. This contradictory behavior is likened to meticulously polishing a weapon that ultimately harms oneself. This represents the third point in the text's progression of arguments about the body's inherent impurity.",

If left in its natural state, the body would display extremely long hair and nails, gray teeth covered with filth, and a frightening naked form smeared with impurities. It is utterly unreasonable to lavish care on something that, like a weapon, ultimately brings harm to oneself.\n\nབདག་ལ་རྨོངས་པའི་འབད་པ་ཡིས། །སྨྱོས་པས་ས་འདི་ཀུན་ཏུ་འཁྲུགས། །\n(Due to efforts born from delusion about the self, madmen disturb this entire earth.)\n\nAlas! Due to delusion that grasps at a self where there is no self and perceives as clean what is actually unclean, beings everywhere disturb and fill this entire earth with their frantic activities. Having drunk the intoxicating liquor of desire, their minds become completely deranged and unstable. People of high, low, and middling status pursue self-interest, feel attachment for loved ones, fight with enemies, and strive for gain, honor, fame, and meaningless adornments. When Bodhisattva heirs observe this world thrown into chaotic turmoil, they see it as if filled with madmen, become disheartened, and tears well up in their eyes from compassion.

The commentaries explain that these are 'mere' or stationary skeletons that are scattered in a charnel ground.\n\n'དུར་ཁྲོད་དུ་ནི་ཡིད་འབྱུང་ན། །' (If one turns away with aversion at the cremation ground...)\nThis line points to the natural revulsion or disheartened feeling that arises when encountering a cremation ground filled with corpses and skeletons. As Commentary 1 notes, one 'turns away with aversion and does not wish to look at or stay in the cremation ground.' This immediate emotional response of disgust or aversion is considered natural.\n\n'གཡོ་བའི་རུས་གོང་གིས་ཁྱབ་པའི། །' (Which is filled with moving skeletons...)\nThe commentaries all highlight that this refers to living humans as 'moving skeletons.' Commentary 1 describes them as 'animated by the mixture of wind and mind,' Commentary 2 as 'animated by the power of intention,' while all suggest these are living beings who are essentially skeletons temporarily covered with flesh and animated by consciousness.\n\n'གྲོང་གི་དུར་ཁྲོད་ལ་དགའ་འམ། །' (Would you delight in the village cremation ground?)\nThe commentaries unanimously interpret this final line as a rhetorical question pointing out the contradiction in human behavior: if one feels revulsion at actual skeletons, how can one then take delight in the 'village cremation ground' (ordinary human society) which is merely filled with 'moving skeletons' (living humans)? As Commentary 1 concludes, 'it is not reasonable to be pleased with or attached to this,' highlighting the inconsistency in being repulsed by death while being attached to living bodies that are destined to become skeletons.",

As long as they do not abandon desire and attachment, they will inevitably take rebirth in samsara through the power of karma, with no chance to practice the three trainings of the path. As it is taught, a person attached to three golden vases was repeatedly reborn as a snake coiled around those vases. 'The more possessions one has, the more suffering one experiences; those with few desires do not suffer so.'",
    "<8><80> Combined Commentary:\n\nFor those attached to and infatuated with sense pleasures and wealth, there are extremely numerous disadvantages and faults as explained earlier and so forth. These include the sufferings previously mentioned and the distraction by various sense objects which, due to the power of karma, cause beings to be repeatedly reborn in samsara. Meanwhile, the pleasurable results and benefits are minimal—mostly just momentary happiness when sense objects and consciousness meet. Those driven by desire, who crave pleasures merely for this life, have no opportunity to be liberated from the suffering of existence and attain liberation. This situation is like when oxen pulling a cart only manage to eat a few mouthfuls of grass while they walk or when, among the many oxen pulling a large cart, some happen to eat a few mouthfuls of grass (gaining minimal benefit) but experience great suffering when their bodies are crushed by the cart wheels (encountering major disadvantages). This pursuit of sense pleasures also represents a fourth fault: the wasting of one's precious human leisure and endowments.",

As stated in the Letter to a Student (Śiṣyalekha): 'The path shown by the Sugata, which leads beings to liberation, and which is obtained by humans with great mental strength—that path is not obtained by gods, nagas, asuras, garudas, knowledge-holders, kinaras, or hungry ghosts.'\n\nYet this supreme opportunity is now being destroyed by those afflicted by various negative past karmas. They waste their freedoms and endowments without engaging in any Dharma activities—be it teaching and studying the three collections of scriptures, practicing the three trainings of the path, engaging in retreat, recitation, or virtuous deeds—and instead spend their lives meaninglessly in distraction, confused about what to adopt and what to abandon.\n\nTherefore, contemplating these disadvantages, one should strive to extract the essence from this support of freedom and fortune. This wasted opportunity is truly an object of compassion for the Victorious Ones and their heirs.",
    "<8><82> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe pleasures dependent upon sensory enjoyments, such as the happiness of royal power, are not permanent or stable, but 'will certainly perish' and are impermanent. Thus, birth ends in death, gathering ends in separation, accumulation ends in depletion, and what is elevated ends in falling. Furthermore, attachment to these pleasures 'causes one to fall into the hell realms and the like' in future lives. For the sake of these impermanent pleasures, one subdues enemies, protects relatives, engages in trade and agriculture, and collects wealth and inheritances—activities whose negative consequences lead to lower rebirths. 'Because it is not of great value' or benefit, either temporarily or permanently, 'therefore at all times it gives rise to great hardship that exhausts one with suffering.' Since beginningless time, beings have been enslaved to desires, experiencing immense hardship and toil to obtain desired objects—suffering that is actually greater than the suffering of one who practices to achieve enlightenment. Ironically, with just a fraction of such difficult practices directed toward spiritual aims, one could easily accomplish Buddhahood itself, yet those attached to inferior goals do not act accordingly.",

    "<8><84> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf one thoroughly contemplates the severe suffering of the hell realms and other lower states (such as hungry ghosts and animals)—which are the direct results of attachment and clinging to sense pleasures and performing negative actions for their sake—then one realizes that regarding the faults of desires, neither being cut by weapons, nor being killed by poison, nor being burned by great fire, nor falling off precipices, nor being destroyed by vicious enemies can serve as adequate comparisons. These dangers cannot fully illustrate the true harm caused by desires because worldly dangers like weapons and poison only separate one from this life temporarily, whereas desire-driven actions can cast one into the lower realms for much longer periods of suffering. Therefore, one should not be attached to desires at all. This understanding serves as a transition to the next topic about cultivating delight in solitude, which will be presented in two sections: a brief explanation connecting the topics, followed by a more detailed explanation.",
    "<8><85> Combined Commentary\n\nThus, having developed disillusionment and weariness with sense pleasures—both inner ones such as women and outer ones such as material gains—considering their harmful effects as worse than poison, one should cultivate joy and delight in the qualities of solitude and practice meditation in seclusion. The commentary now addresses three aspects: the special qualities of an excellent dwelling place; the qualities of attaining self-mastery; and the qualities of contentment.\n\nWhat kind of solitary place should one dwell in? One should dwell in delightful and pleasant forests that are peaceful, where all distractions naturally subside through the blessings of solitude. These places are empty of external disputes for the sake of companions and material gains, and also empty of inner afflictions such as attachment and aversion. They are free from fears of robbers and other dangers.\n\nIn such tranquil forest environments, the fortunate bodhisattva, just as a universal monarch free from rivals might happily stroll in a palace anointed with sandalwood or in a spacious stone mansion cooled by moonlight, walks mindfully while contemplating means to benefit all sentient beings. The gentle, peaceful forest breezes act like fans, creating an atmosphere without harsh sounds. The yogi's dwelling in such solitary places surpasses any worldly pleasure, allowing them to meditate deeply on bodhicitta.",

One dwells in these solitary places for as long as one chooses to remain, free from the distractions of worldly society. Having abandoned the suffering associated with possessing many things and protecting them from deterioration or loss, one relinquishes the burdens of attachment to material objects and dwellings. By renouncing possessive clinging and the constant need to safeguard one's belongings, one lives without expectation or dependence on anyone - whether hoping for favors from the powerful, strategizing how to care for the lowly, anticipating benefits, or fearing harm.

    "<8><89> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'By means of these various aspects,' refers to the qualities of solitude previously mentioned, including outer solitude from distractions, inner solitude from conceptual thoughts, and secret solitude from self-centered intentions, as well as the benefits of dwelling in isolated places free from hustle and bustle.\n\n'Having considered the qualities of solitude,' means one should repeatedly contemplate how maintaining threefold solitude (of body, speech, and mind) serves as the cause of genuine happiness in this and future lives. This reflection should be done thoroughly and repeatedly.\n\n'Pacifying discursive thoughts,' indicates that one should calm all conceptual thoughts of desire, craving, and attachment toward both outer and inner objects. When the mind becomes free from such disturbing thoughts, it becomes workable and pliable.\n\n'And cultivate the mind of awakening,' instructs that with a mind made workable through solitude and the pacification of discursive thoughts, one should then meditate on bodhicitta (the awakening mind). This marks the beginning of the section on cultivating conventional bodhicitta, which consists of three aspects: equalizing self and other, exchanging self and other, and their common practices.\n\nIn essence, this verse explains that the practice of solitude and thought-pacification creates the ideal mental foundation upon which bodhicitta meditation can properly develop and flourish.",
    "<8><90> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བདག་དང་གཞན་དུ་མཉམ་པ་ནི། །' (Equalizing self and others)\nOf the two types of conventional bodhicitta—equalizing self and other, and exchanging self and other—one should first meditate on equalizing self and other. Without this foundation, one cannot achieve the exchange, and a pure mind that benefits others cannot arise. This is the first step in developing relative bodhicitta.\n\n'དང་པོ་ཉིད་དུ་འབད་དེ་བསྒོམ། །' (From the very beginning, one should strive diligently to meditate on this)\nOne should diligently cultivate this practice of equalizing self and others right from the beginning of the spiritual path. This requires consistent effort, as it forms the basis for all further development of bodhicitta. Without diligent practice from the outset, the transformation of mind cannot properly take place.\n\n'བདེ་དང་སྡུག་བསྔལ་མཉམ་པས་ན། །' (Since happiness and suffering are equal)\nThe method for meditating on this equality is based on recognizing that all sentient beings, just like oneself, equally desire happiness and do not want suffering. This fundamental similarity is the basis for developing impartial compassion. The distinction between self and other is merely a mental imputation without inherent existence, ultimately pointing to the crucial understanding of selflessness.\n\n'ཐམས་ཅད་བདག་བཞིན་བསྲུང་བར་བྱ། །' (One should protect all just as oneself)\nBased on this recognition of equality in desiring happiness and avoiding suffering, one should strive to cultivate a mindset where all sentient beings are protected and cherished just like oneself. This means working to bring happiness to all beings and eliminate their suffering with the same dedication one applies to oneself. Though this might seem impossible due to the countless number of beings, it becomes achievable when one realizes the empty nature of both self and other.",

In reality, what we call 'body' is merely a label applied to a collection of many parts, without any inherently existing single entity, yet we instinctively protect it as one.\n\n**དེ་བཞིན་འགྲོ་བ་ཐ་དད་བདེ་སྡུག་དག །ཐམས་ཅད་བདག་བཞིན་བདེ་བ་འདོད་མཉམ་གཅིག །**\n\nSimilarly, although the six classes of beings (such as gods and humans) are distinct and their specific pleasures and pains differ, all sentient beings are fundamentally equal to oneself in not wanting suffering and desiring happiness.

However, just as we label the collection of body parts as 'mine,' there is no logical reason why we cannot extend our sense of selfhood to include all beings. By mentally training to consider all suffering beings as 'self,' we can develop a sense of caring for all sentient beings as ourselves, leading to the arising of a mind that protects all beings equally.",
    "<8><92> Combined Commentary on the Verse\n\n*Now I will explain this verse sentence by sentence, integrating insights from the available commentaries:*\n\n**'Even though my suffering does not directly harm the bodies of other sentient beings,'**\nThis line acknowledges a fundamental truth - that my personal suffering does not physically affect others' bodies. Just as another's suffering does not harm oneself directly, my pain remains contained within my own experience and does not transfer to others in a physical sense. This establishes the apparent separation between self and other that we typically perceive.\n\n**'Nevertheless, that very suffering is my suffering.'**\nHere, the verse points out that despite this separation, I still identify this suffering as 'mine.' This suffering belongs to me and appears as something I must address. This introduces the relationship between suffering and identity.\n\n**'Because of clinging to oneself as 'I,''**\nThis line reveals the cause of our reaction to suffering - self-clinging or self-attachment. The reason we find suffering intolerable is precisely because we grasp at a notion of 'I' and 'mine.' This attachment to self creates the conditions for suffering to become unbearable. Similarly, through training, we can develop the same attitude toward others, regarding their suffering as something we cannot tolerate.\n\n**'This suffering becomes unbearable.'**\nThe final line shows the result of self-clinging - we find our suffering impossible to bear. Due to our attachment to self, even minor discomfort becomes significant. This same mechanism of finding suffering unbearable can be redirected through meditation practice, so that we find others' suffering equally unbearable. Through habituating ourselves to regard other beings as 'self,' we can develop genuine compassion where others' suffering becomes as difficult to bear as our own, even though it does not physically affect us.\n\nThis verse serves as part of a logical proof establishing the basis for equalizing self and others in meditation practice, showing how the same psychological mechanism that makes us protect ourselves can be extended to others.",
    "<8><93> Combined Commentary Explanation of the Verse\n\n**'Similarly, although the suffering of other beings does not directly affect me,'**\nHere, the verse begins by acknowledging that others' suffering does not physically impact us directly. From beginningless time until now, we have been conditioned to view others' suffering as separate from our own. As Commentary 2 notes, there is no fault in this reasoning at a conventional level—others' suffering truly does not directly harm our own bodies.\n\n**'nevertheless, for a bodhisattva, the suffering of others is their own suffering;'**\nDespite this separation, the commentaries explain that a bodhisattva views others' suffering as their own. Commentary 3 clarifies that if one clings to another person as 'self,' their suffering becomes one's own. This is not merely theoretical but has logical backing—as Commentary 2 states, others' suffering should be eliminated by me because it is suffering, just like my own suffering.\n\n**'due to self-identification with others, this suffering becomes unbearable.'**\nAll three commentaries emphasize that through self-identification with others, their suffering becomes unbearable to us. Commentary 1 provides illustrative examples: a mother who would rather die than see her child suffer, Lord Atisha's disciple who directly took on others' suffering, and even the Buddha who identified with a goose shot by Devadatta. Commentary 1 explains that this identification doesn't require lengthy familiarization—just as when selling a horse, attachment and concern shift quickly between buyer and seller.\n\nThe commentaries further explain that 'self' and 'other' lack inherent existence and are merely mental imputations, like 'far side' and 'near side.' There is no established reason why I myself am 'self' and others are 'not-self'—these are merely mental labels that can be transformed through training. As Commentary 1 quotes the Buddha: there is nothing easier to tame than the mind when properly trained, and nothing more disobedient than the untrained mind.\n\nThrough this understanding, by mentally designating and grasping other sentient beings as 'self,' we develop genuine compassion that cannot tolerate even their slightest suffering, as if our entire body were on fire.",
    "<8><94> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'I shall remove the suffering of others, since it is suffering just like my own suffering. I shall benefit others, since they are sentient beings just like my own body.'\n\nIn this verse, the author establishes logical reasoning for why we should remove others' suffering and bring them benefit. The first line states the commitment to remove the suffering of other sentient beings. The second line provides the logical reason: because their suffering is fundamentally the same as our own suffering. Just as I naturally work to eliminate my own suffering from hunger, thirst, and so forth, I should equally strive to remove others' suffering since there is no fundamental difference between their suffering and mine.\n\nThe third line establishes the commitment to benefit other beings and establish happiness for them. The fourth line provides the reasoning: because they are sentient beings deserving of happiness, just as I naturally work to benefit and care for my own body. This creates a logical pervasion - if I care for my own body because it is a sentient being, then I should equally care for other sentient beings.\n\nWhen we develop attachment to others as 'self,' their suffering becomes unbearable to us, just as our own suffering is. This understanding creates the foundation for equalizing self and others - recognizing that the objects of happiness and suffering are similar, and the desiring subjects are similar as well. Thus, there is no logical basis for prioritizing our own happiness over others' or for being more concerned with our own suffering than with the suffering of others.",
    "<8><95> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen both myself and other sentient beings are equally desirous of obtaining happiness, what distinction or difference is there between myself and others? There is none whatsoever. For what reason, then, should I strive for happiness for myself alone without also striving for the happiness of others? It is not reasonable to focus exclusively on my own happiness while ignoring the happiness of others, since we are fundamentally equal in our desire for well-being.",
    "<8><96> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nSimilarly, when both I and other sentient beings are equally averse to experiencing suffering, what difference is there between myself and others? There is no difference whatsoever between us in this regard. For what reason, then, do I protect only my own suffering but not the suffering of others? This is not reasonable to do. That is to say, I should not only establish my own happiness while neglecting that of others; both should be cultivated equally. It is illogical to make distinctions in what to accept and reject when the desires are equivalent - both myself and others equally wish to avoid suffering. The Great Commentary explains this as establishing the pervasion of the preceding argument, demonstrating the fallacy that arises when we maintain artificial distinctions between self and others, when in reality the separation into distinct entities is not ultimately real. This points to the reasonableness of abandoning self-grasping and the fallacy of only protecting against suffering that one personally experiences.",
    "<8><97> Combined Commentary\n\nIf I suffer from my own suffering and need to protect myself from it, but I do not protect another from their suffering because it does not directly harm me at present, then this reasoning is deeply flawed. Consider this argument: 'Since suffering that occurs to sentient beings does not harm me, I need not protect them.' This is most unreasonable. For if we follow this logic, then future sufferings—whether gross sufferings of the next life such as those of hell realms, or sufferings that will come in the next month or year, or subtle sufferings that will arise in the very next moment such as lack of food and clothing—none of these directly harm me right now. If these future sufferings do not harm me now, why should I protect myself from them? It would follow that it would be unreasonable to accumulate wealth in youth out of concern for suffering in old age, and similarly, to make efforts in the morning or today to dispel suffering that might arise in the evening or tomorrow. If the suffering of a later time—future suffering—does not harm the person of the earlier time, then why protect against it out of concern it might arise? By your logic, you should not protect yourself from future suffering in lower rebirths either, because that future suffering does not harm you here and now. If one argues, 'If I do not counteract the causes of future suffering in this life, I will have to experience suffering in the future, so it is reasonable to make effort in methods to counteract it,' then the same reasoning should apply to protecting others from suffering.",
    "<8><98> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བདག་གིས་དེ་ནི་མྱོང་སྙམ་པའི། །' (The thought 'I will experience that suffering')\nThis verse addresses the notion where one thinks, 'Although this suffering does not harm me directly in this moment, I will experience that future suffering, so I should protect against it.' This is referring specifically to one's concern about suffering in future lives, which motivates present action.\n\n'རྣམ་པར་རྟོག་དེ་ལོག་པ་སྟེ། །' (That conceptualization is mistaken)\nThis conceptualization that grasps both the coarse aggregates of this and future lives as a singular entity is entirely mistaken. The text identifies this as a fundamental misconception about the nature of personal identity across lifetimes. This is not a refutation from the perspective of ultimate truth, but rather addresses the conventional understanding of continuity.\n\n'འདི་ལྟར་ཤི་བའང་གཞན་ཉིད་ལ། །' (Thus, the one who dies is a different entity)\nThe reason for this misconception is that the entity who dies after departing this life is different from the one in a future birth. When the karma sustaining human existence is exhausted, the final moment of human consciousness ceases. This human consciousness and human aggregates are distinct from what follows in the next rebirth.\n\n'སྐྱེ་བ་ཡང་ནི་གཞན་ཉིད་ཡིན། །' (And the one who is born is also a different entity)\nSimilarly, the birth in a future life is different from the one who died in the previous life. The aggregates that are born (whether in hell or elsewhere) are different from the human aggregates that died. The consciousness that arises later is different from the one that ceased. As illustrated by the analogy of one lamp lighting another, there is continuity without transfer of identity.\n\nDespite this difference between death and rebirth, karma is not wasted, and one does not experience results of actions not performed. This is because the mere clear, aware consciousness continues uninterruptedly as a similar type, transcending both permanence and annihilation through dependent origination. The karmic causality ensures that while consciousness appears differently due to various actions, the results manifest within a continuum that is neither identical to nor entirely different from the previous one.",
    "<8><99> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nགང་ཚེ་གང་གི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་གང་། །\n**When a particular suffering belongs to a particular experiencer...**\n\nThis opening line presents the opponent's position that each person should be concerned only with their own suffering and not the suffering of others. The verse introduces a conditional premise: if we accept that suffering should only be addressed by the one experiencing it.\n\nདེ་ནི་དེ་ཉིད་ཀྱིས་བསྲུངས་ན། །\n**...and that suffering should be protected by that very experiencer alone...**\n\nThis continues the opponent's argument that suffering should be eliminated only by the one experiencing it, not by others. The verse sets up a framework where protection from suffering is the sole responsibility of the suffering entity itself.\n\nརྐང་པའི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་ལག་པས་མིན། །\n**...then the suffering of the foot should not be protected by the hand.**\n\nThis line uses a bodily analogy to challenge the opponent's position. If we apply their logic consistently, then when a thorn pierces the foot, the hand (being different from the foot) should not remove it, since the suffering belongs only to the foot and not to the hand.\n\nཅི་ཕྱིར་དེས་ནི་དེ་བསྲུང་བྱ། །\n**So why should the hand protect [the foot from suffering]?**\n\nThe verse concludes with a rhetorical question that exposes the absurdity of the opponent's position. If we truly believed that suffering should only be addressed by the sufferer, it would be unreasonable for the hand to remove a thorn from the foot. Yet we naturally accept that different parts of the body help each other, suggesting that the same principle should apply between different persons.",
    "<8><100> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf it is objected that 'Although it may not be reasonable or justified to protect in this way, here, due to habitual self-grasping, the mind engages in protecting past and future lives, and limbs and so forth protecting each other,' [the answer is]: That which is unreasonable—whether it be self-grasping and other-grasping, or the suffering resulting from the unreasonableness of self and other—should indeed be abandoned to the best of one's ability.\n\nThis is because grasping at a personal self is deluded regarding its referent and generates all kinds of disasters. When one incorrectly views bodies from earlier and later lives, or morning and evening bodies, etc., as possessions of a single person, one engages in the elimination of one's suffering by another based merely on habitual patterns rather than sound reasoning.\n\nSome argue that individual persons are unrelated to each other, whereas the limbs of a single person form one collection, and the young and old stages of life or earlier and later lifetimes constitute a single continuum. Therefore, while it is reasonable in the latter case for one's suffering to be eliminated by oneself, in the former case it is unreasonable. However, this objection misses the point that whatever is not logically correct—whether it relates to oneself or others—should be abandoned according to one's capacity.",
    "<8><101> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe terms 'continuum' and 'collection' do not exist as inherently autonomous entities. A 'continuum' is false because it consists of many moments that are neither identical nor different, just as a 'garland' is merely designated upon many beads as a single thread of a garland. Similarly, a 'collection' is false, merely designated or nominal rather than substantially established, just as 'army' is designated upon many people assembled with weapons, and so forth.\n\nAlthough separate instances may appear similar, one's previous and future lives are considered a single continuum, and the collection of limbs and other parts forms a single assemblage. However, speaking of a 'single continuum' is illusory, like imposing oneness on many beads in a rosary. And referring to a 'single assemblage' is false, like calling many individuals 'one army' - these are not established as truly singular.\n\nThis is the supreme method for establishing the selflessness of persons, because apart from a permanent, singular, independent self, all objects of self-grasping are based on attachment to continua and collections as self, and thus this teaching shows both to be unestablished and non-existent.\n\nIf one objects: 'The suffering experienced by one person can be alleviated by another person, even though they differ in time and place,' we respond: Since there is no self of a person who experiences suffering, who could possibly have ownership of pleasure and pain? Therefore, since neither continua nor collections exist, the self of a person who is the experiencer of suffering or 'the one who has suffering' does not exist. Thus, who could possess this suffering that is to be experienced? No one possesses it, as there is no possessor.",
    "<8><102> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'སྡུག་བསྔལ་བདག་པོ་མེད་པར་ནི། །' (There is no owner of suffering)\nIn this way, with respect to suffering that is to be experienced, there is no independent 'owner' or controller who experiences suffering. If there is no self, there can also be no other in relation to it, meaning the supposed experiencer of suffering does not exist in an independent way.\n\n'ཐམས་ཅད་བྱེ་བྲག་མེད་པ་ཉིད། །' (All [suffering] is without distinction)\nTherefore, there is no real distinction or division between 'this is my suffering' and 'this is another's suffering.' All suffering—whether conventionally labeled as one's own or others'—is without fundamental distinction, as both self and others are mutually dependent concepts rather than independent realities.\n\n'སྡུག་བསྔལ་ཡིན་ཕྱིར་དེ་བསལ་བྱ། །' (Because it is suffering, it should be eliminated)\nBecause it is suffering, whether one's own or another's, it should be eliminated. Just as one would naturally wish to eliminate one's own suffering, one should strive to eliminate others' suffering as well. If all suffering must be eliminated because of its nature as suffering, then the suffering of others must also be eliminated by oneself.\n\n'ངེས་པས་འདིར་ནི་ཅི་ཞིག་བྱ། །' (What purpose is served by such certainty here?)\nWhat purpose is served by the rigid distinction that 'I will eliminate my suffering but not eliminate others' suffering'? Such a definitive restriction is completely mistaken. If one does not eliminate others' suffering, then logically one's own suffering—being no different in nature from that of other sentient beings—should also not be eliminated. Therefore, one should cherish others just as one cherishes oneself and make great effort to eliminate all suffering.",
    "<8><103> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Why is the suffering of all to be eliminated?' - This rhetorical question raises a philosophical challenge: if there is no inherently existent self that experiences suffering or owns suffering, then why should we be concerned with eliminating suffering at all? Some might argue that without a true self, there's no one to suffer, making elimination unnecessary. However, such argumentation is pointless, as the verse states.\n\n'This is beyond dispute' - The verse asserts that eliminating suffering shouldn't require debate. Even from a conventional perspective, it is simply appropriate to eliminate suffering wherever it occurs, regardless of rigid distinctions between self and others. Since suffering is undesirable by nature, there's no need to argue about whether it should be eliminated.\n\n'If elimination is appropriate, then all suffering should be eliminated' - If one accepts that suffering should be eliminated at all, then logically this should apply to all suffering. The verse points out the inconsistency in wanting to eliminate one's own suffering while disregarding others'. If we recognize the validity of addressing suffering in our own case, consistency demands we extend this same recognition to all beings.\n\n'Otherwise, just like other sentient beings, my suffering also need not be eliminated' - If we choose not to eliminate others' suffering, then by the same reasoning, there would be no basis for eliminating our own suffering either. Our suffering would have no special status demanding elimination compared to the suffering of others. This shows that cherishing oneself while disregarding others creates a logical contradiction in our approach to suffering.\n\nThis reasoning applies equally to the pursuit of happiness as well as the elimination of suffering. The verse ultimately points toward the bodhisattva practice of cherishing others just as one cherishes oneself, making great efforts to eliminate suffering universally rather than selectively.",

    "<8><105> Combined Commentary\n\nIf even a small suffering arises, and if through that single suffering many sufferings of countless beings in saṃsāra can be eliminated, then—because of its immense benefit—it is indeed appropriate for a compassionate one to generate such suffering for oneself and others. For instance, just as one endures the suffering of having one's body cut open to remove a harmful splinter inside, similarly, even though there is suffering, if the suffering of a compassionate one can eliminate many sufferings of other sentient beings, then those endowed with compassion should definitely generate that compassionate suffering in the minds of oneself and many other sentient beings. This principle is illustrated in the Samādhirāja Sūtra, where the Bodhisattva Candraprabha, knowing that the king intended to kill him, willingly accepted his fate rather than avoiding it, recognizing that through his suffering, the suffering of many beings would be exhausted. Even when his attendants tried to dissuade him, he proceeded into the city, demonstrating that even though it is slight, if by a single suffering of a compassionate one, the many sufferings of others can be extinguished, then one who possesses loving-kindness should indeed generate that suffering for oneself and others.",
    "<8><106> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTherefore, the bodhisattva Supuṣpacandra (Flower-Moon-Beautiful), although he knew through his clairvoyance that the king would harm him and kill him, did not eliminate his own suffering by avoiding it, but instead willingly accepted his suffering in order to exhaust the suffering of many other sentient beings. As taught in the Samādhirāja Sūtra, during the degenerate period of the teachings of the Tathāgata King Ratnapadmavikrama (also called Padmottara in some accounts), there was a monk named Supuṣpacandra who, together with seven thousand bodhisattvas, dwelled in a forest called Samantabhadra. Through his clairvoyance, he saw that if he were to go to King Viryadatta's (or Śūradatta's) palace called Ratnavan and teach the Dharma, many hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of beings would attain the higher realms and irreversible liberation, but if he did not teach, they would not attain these. Although he knew that he himself would eventually be killed, he went there and for seven days abstained from food, circumambulating the Tathāgata's nail stupa at night, and during the day teaching the Dharma in various cities, thereby establishing many tens of millions of beings in the higher realms and irreversibility. Even though his retinue tried to dissuade him, he did not listen and entered the city, because he understood that if even a small suffering arises but that single suffering will eliminate the numerous sufferings of countless beings in samsara, then, because of its great purpose, one who is compassionate should appropriately generate such suffering. The king then ordered him killed, but later regretted this and built a stupa for his bones and made offerings to it.",
    "<8><107> Combined Commentary\n\nThus, when one has cultivated one's mindstream in the equality of self and others as previously explained, one takes great delight in pacifying the suffering of other sentient beings. Because of this deep cultivation, one wishes to dispel others' suffering regardless of personal cost. Just as swans joyfully and eagerly enter a lotus lake adorned with various beautiful lotuses that is pleasing to the mind, likewise, one will even joyfully and eagerly enter the Avīci hell for the sake of benefiting others. When engaging in the welfare of others in this way, there is no mental suffering for the bodhisattva, as they disregard their own suffering in favor of alleviating the pain of others. In this regard, if those of Śrāvaka disposition were to object: 'There is no purpose in entering the Avīci hell, since achieving liberation for oneself brings the great joy of pacifying all suffering' or 'Since liberation is great bliss, one should seek one's own liberation; the joy of benefiting others is not great bliss, so why should one delight in engaging in it?'",
    "<8><108> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen innumerable sentient beings are liberated from all suffering and cyclic existence, one's mind becomes thoroughly filled with a special joy that is vast like a great ocean without limit. Is this boundless ocean of joy not enough to satisfy all desired aims? Indeed, it is enough. What purpose is there in desiring mere liberation for oneself alone? As clarified in the commentaries, this means 'What is the purpose of a joyless bliss?' or 'What use is this flavorless happiness?' This teaches that there is no purpose in being separated from the taste of joy and happiness that comes from fulfilling others' welfare. Remembering the kindness of all sentient beings who have treated us with care, one should strive diligently for their sake. Through liberating others, one will obtain liberation incidentally, as is stated: 'Whoever directly realizes the nature of all beings without exception, attains Buddhahood itself merely as a by-product.' Among the qualities that arise in dependence on others, poets can express in words only the tiniest fraction. This is the teaching on why seeking one's solitary liberation lacks the complete joy found in working for the welfare of others.",
    "<8><109> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, even though one works solely for the benefit of others, one has neither pride thinking 'I have accomplished something excellent' nor a sense of wonder or amazement at one's actions. There is no self-satisfaction or conceit thinking 'I have bestowed my kindness upon them.' Since one delights exclusively in accomplishing only the welfare of others—taking joy solely in benefiting them—one also has no expectation for the ripened resultant fruits for oneself, either as reciprocation in this life or as karmic ripening in future lives. This represents the true bodhisattva attitude that finds complete satisfaction in the welfare of others alone, without any ulterior motives or expectations of reward.",

This question leads to the next section addressing this objection.",
    "<8><111> Combined Commentary\n\nThrough repeated habituation, one perceives and grasps the notion 'I' in relation to the seminal and blood drops of others—specifically the father's semen and the mother's blood that formed one's body. Even though there is not even the slightest real entity or self-nature serving as a basis for bondage and confusion in these drops, one still cognizes and clings to the idea 'this is I.' Just as we develop the notion of 'my body' or 'my mind' from what is inherently selfless, we create a false sense of self through habituation.\n\nIf this concept seems challenging, consider that through the power of habituation, we automatically grasp at these physical elements as our 'self' despite their lack of inherent existence. Following this same principle, why should we not be able to grasp another's body as 'self' when habituated to it? Indeed, the Great Commentary affirms that one can do exactly this. When one becomes thoroughly habituated to this practice, a cognition similar to that of one's own self will arise in relation to others.\n\nTherefore, having contemplated the benefits of cherishing others, one should deliberately reject cherishing only one's own body and instead establish that cherishing in relation to others. With diligent practice, this approach will become as effortless as our current habit of self-cherishing, enabling us to genuinely strive to eliminate the suffering of others. This forms the foundation for the method of exchanging self and others, which will be explained in detail in the following sections.",

Though it may seem difficult when one is unaccustomed, through familiarity it becomes possible.\n\nEven though the self has no inherent existence in the drops of semen and blood of others such as one's father and mother, due to the power of habituation, one knows and grasps at it as 'I.' Similarly, if one becomes habituated, why not also grasp at others' bodies as 'self'? When one becomes accustomed in this way, a mindset similar to one's attitude toward oneself will arise.\n\nThere is no difficulty in establishing one's own body as other beings and also other beings as one's own body if one becomes habituated to it, just as one is habituated to self-cherishing. Having contemplated the benefits of cherishing others, one should strive to eliminate the suffering of others.\n\nWhile the Great Commentary includes this teaching under the category of 'equality,' here it is explained under the category of 'exchange,' following the tradition of Śāntideva. This represents the method of exchanging self and other, which is a suitable practice to become accustomed to.",
    "<8><113> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nHaving recognized oneself as flawed with the fault of causing suffering in this life and the next due to self-cherishing, and having understood that cherishing other sentient beings is an ocean of qualities that gives rise to all benefits and happiness, one should completely abandon self-grasping and embrace others through dedicated practice.\n\nThis verse instructs us to recognize that self-cherishing is the source of all faults and should be strongly opposed as it is fraught with defects, while cherishing other sentient beings is the source of all excellent collections and should be recognized as an ocean of qualities. With this understanding, one should completely abandon self-cherishing and cultivate cherishing others.\n\nThe practice of exchanging self and others includes several aspects: exchanging the cherishing of self and others, exchanging the physical basis, exchanging pleasure and pain, and exchanging virtue and vice. This text specifically addresses the first three.\n\nThis section has multiple parts: a general explanation of the exchange method, specific meditation on particular antidotes, how to practice after the exchange, taking up others, giving up self, the distinctions between faults and virtues of prioritizing self versus others, the disadvantages of not exchanging, and a summary.\n\nSome might object that since sentient beings are limitless, it is impossible to grasp them as oneself, but the text shows that it is indeed reasonable to do so, and explains the ability, virtues, and instructions for accomplishing this practice.",
    "<8><114> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as one's own hands and so forth, though individually distinct, are considered parts of one's own body and thus worthy of protection, similarly, why should divine beings, nāgas, humans, and other sentient beings of the six realms not be considered as limbs of the world to be protected, just as we protect our own body?\n\nIf one may wonder how to hold many distinct sentient beings as a single self, consider this example: Just as hands and other limbs, when differentiated, are many distinct parts, yet all of them are collectively held and designated as 'body' in the singular, similarly, though there are many sentient beings, if one becomes accustomed to cherishing them, they should be regarded as parts of a whole.\n\nMultiple parts such as hands are considered to be parts of a single body, and in the same way, sentient beings are parts of the world, so why not consider them as a single entity and have the same attitude toward acceptance and rejection for all—since the logic in both cases is equivalent?\n\nThis explanation relates to the practice of exchanging self and others, which involves cultivating cherishing of others, strenuously abandoning self-cherishing, and contemplating the faults and virtues of prioritizing self and others. Through habituation, one can generate the mind that sees all sentient beings as worthy of the same care as one's own body.",
    "<8><115> Combined Commentary\n\nJust as, through habituation, the conception of 'self' or 'I' naturally arises in relation to this body that lacks a self-entity and serves as the basis for confusion about liberation—one thinks 'when I am happy, my self is happy' and 'when I suffer, my self suffers'—similarly, why would the conception of 'I' or 'mine' not arise toward other sentient beings as well through repeatedly habituating oneself to regarding them as oneself? Through the same process of habituation, it certainly will arise, since the reasoning is equivalent. When one becomes fully habituated to regarding all sentient beings as oneself, then even when working for the benefit of others, there arises neither amazement nor self-importance, as the distinction between self and other dissolves. This cultivation of exchanging self for others produces tremendous spiritual qualities and benefits.",
    "<8><116> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Thus, even if I perform actions for the benefit of other sentient beings, I do not develop a sense of wonder or attachment thinking 'I am superior.'' This verse explains that when one truly views others as oneself through proper habituation, helping others becomes natural, without generating pride or self-congratulation. Just as self-grasping arises toward our selfless bodies through familiarity, likewise through becoming accustomed to cherishing other sentient beings, the sense of 'mine' naturally extends to them.\n\n'Just as when I myself eat my own food, I do not expect a reward or karmic result in return.' This comparison illustrates that when one genuinely views others as oneself, benefiting them becomes as natural and expectation-free as feeding oneself. When you eat food to satisfy your own hunger, you don't expect thanks or reward from yourself—it's simply meeting a need. Similarly, when helping others is done from the perspective that they are not separate from oneself, one acts without hope for recognition, reward, or karmic return.\n\nThrough this practice of equating self and other, one develops a mind that naturally protects beings from suffering with the same instinctive care with which one protects oneself from unpleasant experiences, all without the burden of pride or expectation of results.",
    "<8><117> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**Therefore, just as one protects oneself even from the slightest harm** such as mere unpleasant words that say 'you have done something slightly wrong,' **in the same way, one should cultivate a mind of protection and compassion toward other sentient beings.**\n\nFor example, just as when one eats one's own food, one does not expect something in return, similarly one should practice compassion toward others without expectation. Since there are boundless benefits to this practice, **just as one wishes to protect oneself even from unpleasant words, in the same way one should cultivate both the mind of protection toward beings from suffering and the mind of compassion.**\n\n**Since it is logical, possible, and beneficial**, we should extend to others the same care we naturally give ourselves. According to the Namshé commentary, the repetition of 'compassion' alongside 'protective attitude' indicates that we should also cultivate 'the mind of loving-kindness' toward all beings. This represents the third point in the teaching sequence.",
    "<8><118> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTherefore, the protector Avalokiteśvara, with great compassion, blessed even his own name to dispel the fears of beings, from the smallest harm to others that must be prevented. Noble Lord Avalokiteśvara, out of his immense compassion, blessed his own name through the power of his aspiration prayers, meditation, and wisdom so that merely hearing or recalling it would protect sentient beings from all fears. In order to eliminate not only the great fears of the three realms of cyclic existence but even the slightest anxiety one might feel in an assembly or gathering, he made this special blessing. As stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: 'By remembering my name three times, may one be free from all fears such as being burned by great fire or being swept away by great floods,' which specifically includes 'may one be free from the fear of nervousness in the midst of an assembly.' Since the mind has become extremely well-habituated to these fears, Avalokiteśvara ensured that simply by recalling his name three times, beings could be protected from even minor anxieties. Although the benefits of this practice are great, one might object, thinking 'Such a practice of exchanging self and other would be difficult for me to habituate to,' which will be addressed next.",
    "<8><119> Combined Commentary\n\nOne should not turn away from difficulties, for when one becomes accustomed to them, they become easy. \n\nThrough the power of gradually becoming familiar with practices, at first, when one is not yet accustomed, merely hearing the name of difficult practices like exchanging self and other—taking on others' suffering and so forth—can cause great fear. \n\nAs the verse states, through the power of familiarity, even with beings whose mere name causes fear when heard, if one becomes accustomed to dwelling together with them, one will become unhappy when they are absent.\n\nSimilarly with spiritual practices that initially seem difficult - through growing familiar and habituated to them, one comes to value them so much that one becomes unhappy when they are absent. For example, just as initially one might be terrified upon merely hearing the name of a certain being, yet through growing familiar with that same being, one comes to like it so much that one becomes unhappy when it is not present.\n\nIn this way, through the power of familiarization, practices that once seemed daunting can be developed to the point where we miss them when we cannot engage in them.",
    "<8><120> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, whoever wishes to quickly protect oneself and all other sentient beings from all the miseries and sufferings of cyclic existence should practice the supreme secret of exchanging self and others. This practice should be kept secret and hidden from unsuitable vessels because it is not within the domain of practice of śrāvakas and others, and it is the ultimate key point of the Mahāyāna path. The second section of the text contains two parts: the first contemplates how self-cherishing is the cause of all fears and explains how, by generating fear in this life, it is appropriate to abandon self-cherishing; the second part contemplates how self-cherishing engages one in all misdeeds.",
    "<8><121> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nTowards this body, to which one is attached and has strong affection, one experiences fear even from minor sources of danger such as flies, gnats, venomous snakes and the like. Due to my attachment to this body, even small dangers cause great fear to arise. What need is there to mention major sources of fear? Given that one's own body has become the basis for generating various fears in this and future lives, what intelligent person would not regard it as an enemy and feel aversion toward it? Therefore, regarding this body of mine which gives rise to all fears, what wise person would not loathe it like an enemy and hate it? Without exchanging self and other, it is unreasonable to cherish this body and have attachment to it. Rather, one should develop aversion to it, since it not only produces suffering in this life but also in future lives, making it reasonable to abandon attachment to it.",
    "<8><122> Combined Commentary:\n\nIn this verse, the commentary highlights how some people, motivated by selfishness and desire to alleviate their bodily discomforts, commit harmful actions. Whoever, wishing to perform remedies or rituals for curing their body's ailments such as hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and other illnesses, engages in destructive behavior. Specifically, they kill birds, fish, wild animals, cattle and similar creatures for the sake of food, clothing, and other personal needs. Furthermore, these same individuals lie in wait on roads to ambush travelers, stealing or robbing others of their possessions and wealth. This extreme self-cherishing can lead to such severe moral degradation that a person might even harm those who have been kind to them, including potentially their own parents, all for the sake of personal gain, profit, and honor.",

This is exemplified by historical examples such as King Ajātaśatru who killed his father and Queen Vaidehī's son who killed his mother.\n\n'དཀོན་མཆོག་གསུམ་གྱི་དཀོར་བརྐུས་ནས།' (After stealing the possessions of the Three Jewels) describes the act of taking what belongs to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, whether through direct selling by deception or by secretly stealing, thereby accumulating extremely negative karma.\n\n'དེས་ནི་མནར་མེད་བསྲེག་འགྱུར་ན།' (Will consequently be burned in the Avīci hell) warns of the inevitable result of such actions—the perpetrator will experience unbearable suffering in the Avīci hell, being intensely burned by extreme heat. This verse asks implicitly: what wise person would cherish, desire, protect, and worship a body that leads to such consequences? This forms part of the teaching on the faults of self-cherishing and the benefits of cherishing others.",
    "<8><124> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Which learned person would desire, protect, and worship this body?' This verse questions why any wise person would cherish, desire to keep, protect with affection, or worship this body with food, clothing, ornaments, and other offerings. The commentary emphasizes that such attachment to the body is inappropriate for someone seeking their own true welfare.\n\n'Who would not view it as an enemy and who would not disparage it?' Here, the verse suggests that a wise person should actually view the body as a dangerous enemy and treat it with appropriate caution rather than blind affection. This teaching aims to reverse the mind's habitual cherishing attachment that mistakenly clings to the body as the self.\n\nThe verse serves as part of the third section of the text, which has two main components: enumerating the disadvantages and benefits of cherishing self versus others, and explaining why abandoning self-cherishing is appropriate. This particular verse addresses the distinctive aspects of how we perceive physical appearances.\n\nThe commentary reminds us that the body can lead to serious wrongdoing - even extreme actions like stealing from the Three Jewels, which would result in rebirth in the Avīci hell. Therefore, wise practitioners should recognize the body as a source of suffering in this life and the next, not as something to be cherished unconditionally.",
    "<8><125> Combined Commentary\n\n'If I give to others, what will I have to eat, wear, and enjoy?' This mindset of prioritizing one's own welfare leads to stinginess and miserliness. Such exclusive concern for oneself is the way of demons because it generates fear and anxiety. This self-centered thinking causes rebirth as hungry ghosts, flesh-eating spirits, and other malevolent beings. It represents the conduct of demons and the way of hungry ghosts—truly an evil approach.\n\nConversely, 'If I use these things for myself, what will I have to give to other sentient beings?' This mindset of prioritizing others' welfare is the dharma of the gods, a noble religious tradition. Through giving, great joy and happiness arise in this and future lives. This exclusive concern for others gives rise to all excellent qualities and represents the excellent dharma practice of buddhas and bodhisattvas who are accustomed to generosity.\n\nFor example, in ancient times, when rain did not fall for twelve years in King Brahmadatta's kingdom, he sustained his subjects from the royal treasury. Finally, when only one measure of barley remained for his own sustenance, he offered it to a pratyekabuddha, whose miraculous powers then caused rain to fall, relieving the famine.",
    "<8><126> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf one harms others for one's own sake, seeking to free oneself from suffering and attain happiness by causing harm to other sentient beings' bodies and possessions, one will be tormented by suffering in the hells and other lower realms. This negative action of harming others, such as by killing, for one's own selfish purposes leads to inevitable karmic consequences of falling into lower states of existence.\n\nHowever, if one sacrifices one's own body and possessions for the sake of others—that is, if one gives these up for their benefit—one will attain all excellent qualities. This means if one harms oneself (through sacrifice) for the sake of others' happiness and welfare, one will obtain all forms of prosperity and excellent qualities.\n\nThis self-sacrifice for others' benefit leads to both the temporary higher states and the ultimate perfections of Buddhahood. Our Teacher (the Buddha) exemplifies this principle, as in the past, he attained enlightenment precisely by giving away all his body and possessions to others, demonstrating the path of obtaining all excellent prosperity through selfless actions.",
    "<8><127> Combined Commentary\n\nThose who desire to elevate themselves above others in terms of physical appearance, social status, retinue, possessions, praise, and fame will experience serious negative consequences. Such self-aggrandizing attitudes lead to rebirth in the lower realms in future lives. Even if one manages to obtain a human rebirth, they will be born with inferior status, possibly of low caste, have an unattractive appearance, and possess a dull, confused, and foolish intellect.\n\nHowever, if one takes this very same desire for elevation and transfers it to others—sincerely wishing for other sentient beings to be elevated instead of oneself—the results will be completely opposite. By cultivating the wish to elevate others rather than oneself, one will attain rebirth in the higher realms as a lord among gods and humans. In these fortunate rebirths, one will also receive perfect honor, respect, and excellent service from others.",
    "<8><128> Combined Commentary\n\nIf one exploits other sentient beings as servants for the purpose of fulfilling one's own happiness and desires, coercing them without their freedom and making them slaves, one will experience suffering in future lives as a servant, slave, hired laborer, and other forms of low birth. For example, it is taught that when Gragdzin-ma carried her son in her womb for six years, this was the ripened result of having forced someone else to carry a full water vessel in a previous life.\n\nConversely, if one allows oneself to be used as a servant for the purpose of fulfilling the happiness of other sentient beings, employing oneself for their benefit and giving oneself for their happiness, one will experience favorable circumstances in future lives. One will be reborn as a master, lord, or other high position, possessing excellent attendants and servants, having good birth, fine form, and an entourage.\n\nThis teaching demonstrates the karmic principle that the way we treat others determines our future circumstances, with selfishness leading to servitude and selflessness leading to prosperity and leadership.",

In contrast, the Sage accomplishes the welfare of others, through which all excellent qualities reach perfection, experiencing perfect happiness and fulfilling both their own and others' purposes.\n\nLook at this distinction carefully and be convinced of it.

From the distinction of self and others, attachment and aversion arise. Connected with these, all faults come into being.'

'Apart from working for the benefit of all sentient beings, you should now no longer think about anything else.' This is a clear instruction that the mind should abandon all self-centered concerns and focus exclusively on others' welfare. 'Do not contemplate anything other than accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings; do not think of pursuing solely your own benefit and the like.' Having genuinely exchanged oneself with others, one must completely relinquish selfish pursuits and dedicate oneself solely to benefiting others in all activities. This verse establishes the practitioner's commitment to living entirely for the sake of others' happiness, having fully internalized the practice of exchanging self and others.",
    "<8><138> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nSince one has already given away everything to all sentient beings, it is not proper to pursue one's own aims through actions such as looking, listening, and walking with the eyes, ears, legs, and so forth that belong to other sentient beings. If one dedicates oneself as a servant of sentient beings, it is inappropriate to misuse one's eyes and other faculties against the one whose servant one has become. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use eyes and other faculties that belong to other sentient beings to look at sentient beings with anger and so forth, or to pursue solely one's own purposes. Rather, one must accomplish the purposes of those to whom these faculties belong. And it is never appropriate to misuse the eyes, hands, and so forth that have been given for the benefit of those other sentient beings by doing any wrong to those sentient beings, such as glaring at them or striking them. The phrase 'for that purpose, the eye' is explained in some commentaries as referring to 'the hand' - both eyes and hands should not be misused against others because they have been given for the sake of others. Thus, if one observes oneself acting improperly toward sentient beings through the three doors [of body, speech, and mind], one should contemplate the faults of this and repeatedly generate the resolve to exercise restraint.",
    "<8><139> Combined Commentary\n\nFor this reason, one should make other sentient beings primary and prioritize their welfare above one's own. Whatever pleasurable enjoyments, food, clothing, ornaments, and desired objects that one sees on one's own body, one should take these things away from oneself—that is, remove one's sense of ownership and attachment to them—and instead use them to benefit other sentient beings who lack such necessities. As the saying goes, 'If your mind becomes timid when giving a full measure, develop the courage to give a whole load,' and 'Take from your own stomach and give to others.' One must give while suppressing attachment and clinging to these possessions. Remember that you should use these things just as a servant uses the food, clothing, and possessions of their master, without a sense of personal ownership.\n\nThis teaching relates to the method of exchanging self and other in one's mind, which has both aspects of intention and application. This practice helps abandon three fundamental faults: jealousy toward those above, competition with equals, and pride toward those below. The instruction represents part of the special antidotes that are cultivated on the bodhisattva path.",
    "<8><140> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nAfter mentally placing oneself in the position of other sentient beings who are inferior, equal, and superior (the three categories indicated by 'etc.'), and similarly placing these three types of others in the position of oneself—in other words, after exchanging positions with one another—one should then, with a mind free from conceptual elaborations or doubt, meditate upon specific emotions.\n\nWhen a bodhisattva practices this exchange of self and other, they should cultivate these emotions with full conviction in the exchange. If the practitioner is someone like Devadatta, then after the exchange, they should meditate on jealousy toward those who are superior (when having exchanged with the inferior), competitiveness toward those who are equal (when having exchanged with equals), and pride toward those who are inferior (when having exchanged with the superior).\n\nThis section of the text contains multiple parts addressing how to cultivate each of these emotions after the exchange of self and other has been accomplished, beginning with how to meditate on jealousy, followed by competitive feelings, and finally pride. The practice starts with jealousy regarding worldly phenomena and continues through a systematic meditation on each emotion from the perspective of having exchanged oneself with others.",
    "<8><141> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འདི་ནི་བཀུར་བྱས་བདག་ནི་མིན། །' (This one is honored, while I am not)\nIn this first line, 'this one' (འདི་ནི) refers to others whom we should imagine as superior beings, while 'I' (བདག) refers to ourselves whom we should imagine as lowly sentient beings. This practice requires us to reverse our usual perspective—to see others as deserving honor while viewing ourselves as undeserving due to inferior qualities. For example, when the bodhisattva practices exchanging self and other, he thinks: 'This person (whom I now identify as 'other') is honored by the world because of their excellent qualities, while I (previously identified as 'self' but now imagined as a suffering being) am not honored because my qualities are inferior.'\n\n'འདི་བཞིན་བདག་གིས་མ་རྙེད་ཅིང་། །' (Just as this one has found [favorable things], I have not obtained [them])\nHere we cultivate the feeling that others receive abundant provisions while we ourselves lack even basic necessities. This addresses the worldly concern of gain versus loss, and serves as an antidote to competitive jealousy. We should think: 'Just as this person (previously 'self' but now viewed as 'other') has obtained abundant food, clothing, and wealth, I (now identifying with suffering beings) cannot obtain even basic necessities and experience deprivation.'\n\n'འདི་ནི་བསྟོད་བྱས་བདག་ལ་སྨོད། །' (This one is praised, while I am criticized)\nThis line encourages us to imagine that others receive praise while we face criticism. It addresses the worldly concern of praise versus blame, and serves as an antidote to envy. In practice, we should think: 'While this person (now 'other') is praised as 'wise' and 'virtuous,' I (now identified with suffering beings) am criticized as 'foolish' and experience the pain of disparagement.'\n\n'འདི་བདེ་བདག་ནི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་ལ། །' (This one is happy, while I suffer)\nIn the final line, we cultivate the understanding that others enjoy happiness while we experience suffering. This addresses the worldly concern of happiness versus suffering. We should imagine: 'This person enjoys excellent happiness with abundant prosperity, while I suffer from poverty, mental burden, physical ailments, and exposure to harsh conditions. I perform difficult tasks such as carrying burdens, while this person abides in happiness alone.'\n\nThe entire verse serves as a method to cultivate genuine empathy by reversing our usual self-centered perspective, applying antidotes to pride, competitive jealousy, and envy—the negative emotions that follow even slight virtues in our mindstream like demons following virtuous acts.",
    "<8><142> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'I do various tasks like gathering roots and cutting wood, while this one remains in comfort without having to work.' This verse reflects the practice of exchanging self with others, where one contemplates the disparity in labor and comfort. When practicing this meditation, one should recognize how we often burden others with difficult work while remaining comfortable ourselves, not realizing their suffering and sometimes even becoming angry with them. If we imagine exchanging places with them, we would develop genuine compassion and refrain from causing harm.\n\n'This one is renowned in the world as great.' Here, the practitioner observes how certain beings (like the Bodhisattva Devadatta in one interpretation) are honored and praised for their qualities such as moral discipline and learning. The comparison creates a feeling of envy that should be directed toward the other whom one has taken as 'self' in this meditation. This conscious cultivation of envy serves as a tool for developing genuine empathy.\n\n'While I am known as inferior and devoid of qualities.' In this meditation, one recognizes their seemingly lesser status compared to others. However, we should understand that qualities are acquired through effort, and that superiority and inferiority are merely relative concepts established in relation to reference points. Even those who appear superior to us are inferior to others with greater qualities, just as we ourselves are superior to some. Therefore, rather than becoming discouraged, we should diligently strive to develop positive qualities and work toward enlightenment.",
    "<8><143> Combined Commentary: Sentence by Sentence Explanation\n\n'What use is being without qualities?' This rhetorical question suggests that lacking virtues is undesirable and serves no purpose; rather, we should strive to cultivate good qualities through training and effort.\n\n'Indeed, I should be completely endowed with virtues.' This means we should work diligently to acquire positive qualities, recognizing that we all have the potential to develop them, and we are not completely without qualities since we naturally possess buddha-nature (Tathāgatagarbha), which is inherently pure.\n\n'There are those compared to whom this one is inferior.' This explains that superiority and inferiority are established relationally, not absolutely; even those who seem highly accomplished (like renowned bodhisattvas) are inferior when compared to beings with even greater qualities.\n\n'And there are also those compared to whom I am superior.' This completes the relational understanding by showing that everyone, even those who consider themselves inferior, possesses qualities that surpass others in some respect—whether physical abilities (like walking or seeing) or other capacities—thereby establishing that high and low status is not fixed but depends on the reference point.\n\nIf someone criticizes us for being inferior due to degraded morality or wrong views, we can understand that these faults arise from the power of afflictions and are not under our control, and we can ask those who claim to be compassionate to help heal us from these degradations rather than simply judging us.",
    "<8><144> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས་ལྟ་བ་རྒུད་སོགས་ནི། །**\nThe deterioration of moral discipline (śīla), views (dṛṣṭi), poverty, and other impairments in conduct are not merely because I am a bad or wretched person.\n\n**ཉོན་མོངས་སྟོབས་ཀྱིས་བདག་དབང་མིན། །**\nThese deteriorations are due to the power of adventitious afflictions (āgantuka-kleśa) such as desire, ignorance, and miserliness, which have not come under my own willful control. I am not in command of myself because of these afflictions.\n\n**ཅི་ནུས་བདག་ནི་གསོ་དགོས་ཏེ། །**\nTherefore, if you truly possess the qualities of a bodhisattva endowed with compassion, you should heal me to the best of your ability from these moral failings, wrong views, and material deprivation. You should help restore me as much as you can from these deteriorations.\n\n**གནོད་པའང་བདག་གིས་དང་དུ་བླང་། །**\nJust as a student learning writing must accept hardships such as beatings from the teacher, I will willingly accept whatever difficulties that arise in the process of healing—whether harsh words, criticism, or other challenges. I will voluntarily endure the hardships that come with cultivating virtuous qualities under your guidance.",
    "<8><145> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nHowever, if I am not someone to be cared for by this bodhisattva—meaning if they do not care for me by providing even basic necessities like food and drink, or if they are unable to heal my afflictions—then why does this person show contempt toward me, treating me as inferior while considering themselves superior? There is no justification for such disdain. Even if this bodhisattva Devadatta possesses excellent qualities, if these qualities don't translate into actual benefit for me and other sentient beings, what use are those qualities to me? They serve no purpose whatsoever. Although this bodhisattva may indeed possess admirable qualities themselves, if those qualities don't result in compassionate action that helps others, they bring no benefit to suffering beings like myself.",
    "<8><146> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse refers to those who, like Devadatta, dwell at the precipice of lower realms and harmful destinies, as if in the jaws of vicious beasts such as venomous snakes and wild animals, due to their accumulated negative karma. Such individuals have no compassion for sentient beings who suffer. Not only do they fail to acknowledge this serious fault and refuse to benefit suffering beings, but outwardly they boast about qualities they don't actually possess. In their arrogance and conceit, they challenge and wish to compete with the truly wise ones, inappropriately belittling and disparaging those who genuinely possess compassion and wisdom.\n\nThis behavior represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how bodhisattvas should conduct themselves. One should reflect on how one places one's mind toward other beings, recognizing that a bodhisattva considers others as oneself and would never harm them in such ways. The antidote to such pride is cultivating appreciation for others' qualities, recognizing the suffering of those in inferior positions, and understanding one's own faults of pride and contempt. Instead of arrogance, one should offer respect, share resources, and actively strive to benefit beings through practical application of the teachings.",
    "<8><147> Combined Commentary\n\n'Having observed oneself in comparison to someone who is equal to oneself or slightly superior' refers to looking at another person—possibly a bodhisattva—who is similar to us in terms of sentient birth, lineage, and qualities, and whom one might consider a rival either in Dharma or worldly matters. 'For the purpose of making oneself superior' indicates the motivation is to elevate oneself above this person, perhaps a Devadatta-like figure, in order to appear greater in terms of acquisitions and qualities. 'One should definitely secure one's own gain and veneration' means one deliberately seeks to obtain material possessions, honors, and respect for oneself. 'By seizing it from them, even through conflict and strife' shows that one should take these gains away from others through fighting, disputes, and contention to ensure one's superiority—actions that clearly contradict the bodhisattva path.",

It addresses how we might view those who have been rendered miserable by their own misdeeds.\n\n'ཡུན་རིང་བདག་ནི་དགའ་བས་བལྟ། །' (I shall gladly observe them for a long time) - This line suggests that I should look with joy for a long time at their suffering that resulted from their misdeeds. Through the practice of exchanging self and other, one adopts the perspective of watching this corrupted person with gladness.\n\n'འགྲོ་བ་ཀུན་གྱི་བཞད་གད་དང་། །' (They become an object of laughter for all beings) - They should become an object of mockery and laughter for all beings.

Through this practice of exchanging self and other, one should exalt sentient beings while restraining one's own pride in personal qualities, thus completing the third point of this teaching section.\n\nThis passage relates to the practice of cultivating proper pride by considering those with superior qualities as 'self' while simultaneously addressing one's own harmful competitive tendencies.",
    "<8><151> Combined Commentary:\n\n'This miserable affliction (kleśa)' refers to the prideful thoughts arising in one's mind, which is said to compete or contend with oneself. This afflicted state of mind makes one think: 'This person is competing with me, trying to stand as my equal.' The next lines invite self-reflection on the basis of this prideful competition: 'Are they equal to me in learning and wisdom?' - meaning, am I comparing myself to others based on how much I've studied or how intelligent I am? 'Or in physical appearance, family lineage, and wealth?' - am I measuring my worth against others based on looks, social status, or material possessions? This verse exposes how pride operates by constantly comparing oneself to others, creating a sense that we are either superior or threatened by those we perceive as rivals. The implicit message is that such comparative thinking is itself the affliction that creates suffering.",

These qualities are superior and more illustrious than mere humble attributes.\n\n'སྤུ་ལྡང་དགའ་བ་སྐྱེ་འགྱུར་བའི།' (Will experience joy that raises the hairs of the body): Upon hearing about these excellent qualities, one experiences profound joy that manifests physically as goosebumps or hair standing on end—a bodily expression of intense delight.\n\n'བདེ་སྐྱིད་ལ་ནི་ཡོངས་སུ་སྤྱོད།' (Will fully partake in happiness and well-being): This indicates complete indulgence in the resulting happiness and well-being that comes from such recognition.

As explained in the commentaries, I should not leave anything behind but should appropriate the remainder of those gains for my own use.",
    "<8><154> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འདི་ནི་བདེ་ལས་ཉམས་བྱ་ཞིང་། །' (This inferior one should be deprived of pleasures) - This self-cherishing mind should be removed from the comfort of complacency and deprived of various kinds of pleasures. The bodhisattva should recognize that this self-grasping attitude is an enemy that must be stripped of its happiness and satisfaction.\n\n'བདག་གི་གནོད་དང་རྟག་སྦྱར་བྱ། །' (I should continually subject it to harm) - Not only should I deprive this enemy of pleasure, but I should also constantly subject it to suffering and harm. After taking on my burden of suffering, the bodhisattva should be continuously engaged in eliminating the suffering of sentient beings, which involves subjecting the self-cherishing mind to the 'harm' of selfless activity.\n\n'འདི་ཡིས་བརྒྱ་ཕྲག་ཐམས་ཅད་དུ། །' (This one has in hundreds of ways) - If one asks why there is such hatred toward this self-cherishing attitude, it is because this enemy has inflicted various harms upon me hundreds of times in countless situations throughout all cycles of existence. This mind that wishes to work solely for its own benefit has let countless eons pass in meaningless pursuits.\n\n'འཁོར་བར་བདག་ལ་གནོད་པ་བྱས། །' (Harmed me while wandering in saṃsāra) - While wandering in saṃsāra, this self-cherishing has inflicted great suffering upon me in the realms of hell and so forth throughout hundreds of lifetimes. Though desiring to achieve perfect prosperity for oneself, this attitude has only accomplished the suffering of saṃsāra for me, producing nothing but harm in cyclic existence.\n\nThis passage also connects to the practice of exchanging self for others as an antidote to pride, jealousy, and competitiveness. When we place ourselves in the position of inferiority and meditate on how others' harmful behaviors affect us, we naturally develop compassion and eliminate these negative states of mind, realizing that inflicting such suffering on others is equally inappropriate.",
    "<8><155> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n*O mind, while you have desired to accomplish solely your own benefit*: From this point forward, the terms 'self' and 'other' are used in their normal, straightforward sense.

As Commentary 2 notes, this has led to 'circling in saṃsāra for hundreds of lifetimes,' experiencing various forms of harm.\n\n*You have accomplished nothing but suffering*: The result of all this self-cherishing has produced only tremendous suffering—heat, cold, and numerous other torments—without achieving any lasting happiness. As Commentary 1 emphasizes, this is indeed 'a cause for deep regret,' showing that the self-centered approach should be abandoned in favor of cherishing others.\n\nThis verse reflects the bodhisattva's contemplation on the futility of self-cherishing and serves as a powerful argument for why we should shift our focus to benefiting others instead.",
    "<8><156> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThus, understanding with certainty that pursuing self-interest leads to suffering while cherishing others brings benefit, engage enthusiastically and resolutely in working for the welfare of numerous sentient beings. This engagement should be undertaken through the practice of exchanging self for others as taught by the Buddha. The words of the Sage, the Omniscient Buddha, are authoritative and never deceptive regarding what he taught. If you view self-cherishing as the enemy and instead practice cherishing others, the qualities and results of this practice will later become clear to you. Though one might object that 'despite working for the benefit of others for a long time, I have not seen such results,' the Buddha's teachings are unfailing, and you will eventually witness the profound qualities of this practice when you gradually attain the noble grounds, ultimately leading to the attainment of Buddhahood.",

Just as you grasp at this body formed from droplets of semen and blood thinking 'this is my body,' likewise you should become habituated to seeing other sentient beings as yourself and exert yourself for their benefit.\n\nThis verse presents the instruction on actually exchanging oneself with others, seeing the great benefits in working for the welfare of others. Through such cultivation, you will eventually perfect this practice of cherishing others as dear.\n\nThis section on application has two parts: the method of accomplishing the application and using the application to bring the mind under control.

    "<8><160> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse invites us to shift our perspective about envy in a thought-provoking way.\n\n'I am happy while others are not happy.' Here, the verse prompts self-reflection: as a follower of the compassionate Buddha who wears the saffron robes and properly trains in the teachings, I have found a path to genuine happiness in both this life and the next. Meanwhile, other beings who have committed negative actions experience suffering and lack true happiness. Rather than envying others, shouldn't I recognize how fortunate my position is?\n\n'I am high while others are low.' This line points out that I am elevated as an object of others' veneration through following the dharma path, while other beings remain lowly, burdened by various obligations and lacking freedom day and night due to taxes and other worldly concerns. This elevated spiritual status is worth recognizing.\n\n'I benefit myself, but others do not do likewise.' I perform virtuous actions that create benefit for myself in this life and the next, while others engage in many harmful actions and few beneficial ones. I have discovered ways to help myself through dharma practice, while others have not found this path.\n\n'Why should I not feel jealousy toward myself?' This provocative conclusion suggests that instead of feeling envy toward others' temporary worldly advantages, I should recognize my own fortunate position on the spiritual path and feel a kind of 'envy' toward myself. This clever reversal encourages us to appreciate our spiritual opportunities rather than coveting worldly status. Since I am happy and other sentient beings are not happy, it is fitting to direct the energy of jealousy toward recognizing my own elevated status and fortunate position.",

This means that whatever harmful actions you have previously committed for your own benefit should now fall upon yourself for the purpose of accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings.

The term 'gnya' drag' (stiff-necked) refers to a rough or unruly manner, like a child who has become undisciplined. When practicing the bodhisattva path, even if one feels 'I cannot bear to take on the suffering of others,' one should not allow the mind to become forceful, reckless, or filled with pride.\n\n**Line 3-4: བག་མ་གསར་པའི་ཚུལ་བཞིན་དུ། །ངོ་ཚ་འཇིགས་དང་བསྡམས་ཏེ་བཞག །**\nInstead, the mind should be maintained like a new bride who has just arrived in her husband's home - modest, careful in conduct, and restrained. One should feel a sense of shame regarding improper behaviors such as self-cherishing and self-centered attention, experience fear of the faults and others' criticism that arise from such actions, and keep oneself in check by not engaging in these negative activities. Through this threefold approach of shame, fear, and restraint, the mind is brought under control and disciplined, establishing the foundation for the bodhisattva practice.",

The physical body is merely matter and bears no fault - it is upon the mind that all faults depend.\n\nWhen the mind makes excuses, claiming to be under the influence of afflictions and unable to act according to the instructions, we must recognize that this resistance itself demonstrates why the mind must be subdued. This verse forms part of the section on abandoning the pursuit of self-interest alone after contemplating its disadvantages, which is the first of three parts in this section of the text.",
    "<8><169> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Where can you go, having been seen by me? I shall destroy all your pride. This is different from that previous time when I was destroyed by you.'\n\nIn this verse, the speaker is addressing the self-cherishing mind. The time when this mind was able to destroy the speaker by pursuing selfish interests was different from the present moment. In the past, the speaker didn't recognize the faults of the self-cherishing mind and was led down a wrong path, allowing the mind to destroy them.\n\n'You' refers specifically to the mind that cherishes self-interest. By pursuing its own interests, it misled the speaker previously when they couldn't see its true nature.\n\nThat previous time when the speaker didn't perceive the faults of self-cherishing is different from now. The phrase 'that previous time' indicates either 'now I see your faults' or 'that previous time has passed and things are not like before.'\n\nNow, having understood the teachings (specifically the Bodhicaryāvatāra), the speaker has recognized the self-cherishing mind as the root of all faults and has seen all the problems caused by its self-serving actions.\n\nThe question 'Where will you go?' indicates that the self-cherishing mind has no escape or freedom to flee while generating these faults. It cannot hide anywhere from the speaker's awareness.\n\nFinally, the speaker declares they will utterly demolish all the arrogance and pride of self-interest, such as seeking gain and praise. The self-cherishing mind must abandon the thought that it 'still has the power to accomplish only my own aims.' The speaker will not allow the self-cherishing mind to accomplish even the slightest selfish thing.",
    "<8><170> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Now abandon that thought, thinking: 'I still have my own purpose to accomplish.'' This verse instructs us to give up the self-cherishing attitude that believes we still have personal purposes to fulfill separate from others' welfare. It's addressing the ego directly, telling it to relinquish its hold over us.\n\n'I have sold you to others' means the practitioner has committed or dedicated themselves to serving all sentient beings through the practice of exchanging self and others. The 'self' or ego has been sold or given away, and no longer belongs to oneself but to all other beings.\n\n'Without becoming discouraged about working for the benefit of others, offer your service wholeheartedly.' This line encourages us not to become disheartened about accomplishing the welfare of others, but rather to exert ourselves diligently. We should offer our 'labor and flesh' to sentient beings according to their wishes without feeling dejected.\n\nThis represents a fundamental shift in attitude - from self-cherishing to self-giving - recognizing that the self-cherishing attitude is the root of all faults. By dedicating ourselves completely to others' welfare, we counteract this harmful attitude and cultivate genuine altruism.",

It addresses the self-cherishing mind directly as 'you,' establishing a dialogue with this harmful mental tendency.\n\n'སེམས་ཅན་རྣམས་ལ་མ་བྱིན་ན། །' (If you do not give to sentient beings...)\nThis line explains the specific form of heedlessness—failing to give oneself to other sentient beings. The commentaries emphasize that we should offer whatever sentient beings desire and need, without feeling disheartened, as we have essentially 'sold ourselves' to the welfare of others.\n\n'ཁྱོད་ཀྱིས་ཁོ་བོ་དམྱལ་བ་ཡི། །' (You will [give] me to hell's...)\nHere, the verse explains the consequence of such selfishness—the self-cherishing mind will lead one to accumulate sinful karma, causing the person to be delivered to the realms of hell. The commentaries clarify that by serving self-interest instead of others, one subjects oneself to future suffering.\n\n'སྲུང་མ་རྣམས་ལ་བྱིན་དུ་ངེས། །' (You will certainly give to the guardians.)\nThe final line confirms the certainty of this consequence—being handed over to the terrifying guards of hell who inflict torment and extreme suffering.

If you wish to protect yourself from suffering, cherish other sentient beings and constantly protect them.\n\nThis teaching addresses the abandoning of attachment to the body and the method of holding the body as belonging to others. It demonstrates the disadvantages of craving for the body and why it is proper to meditate on detachment from the body. Some might argue that 'one who wants to benefit others should sustain the body through attachment,' but this passage shows the faults of such thinking: insatiability, inflexibility, and delusion. Instead, it reveals the qualities of contentment that come from protecting others rather than oneself.",

It is simply impossible. As it is wisely said: 'All the grains upon the earth, gold, cattle, and states of health—none of these will satisfy even a single person. Understanding this, pacify your mind.' This truth is illustrated by the example of King Māndhātā (also known as Nagnajit or Nanda in different traditions), who, despite becoming the lord of the four continents and obtaining half of Indra's throne in heaven, remained unsatisfied with his immense possessions and ultimately fell due to his insatiable craving. This demonstrates that it is impossible to find satisfaction through craving for sense pleasures, no matter how much one acquires.",
    "<8><176> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'ནུས་མེད་འདོད་པ་ལ་ཉོན་མོངས་དང་། །' \nThose who desire what they cannot achieve experience suffering—that is, they become afflicted with attachment, aversion, and so forth.

The virtuous mind becomes disrupted when desires cannot be fulfilled.\n\n'གང་ཞིག་ཀུན་ལ་ལྟོས་མེད་པ། །'\nThe noble person who remains free from dependence on any desirable qualities such as family, friends, or possessions—having few desires and being content—dwells without concern for body and possessions.\n\n'དེ་ཡི་ཕུན་ཚོགས་ཟད་མི་ཤེས། །'\nThat person's qualities of excellence and happiness are inexhaustible. For them, it is impossible to ever experience the distress of being deprived of possessions. As stated in the Letter to a Friend: 'Among all forms of wealth, contentment is supreme—thus taught the Teacher of gods and humans. Practice contentment in all things; if you know contentment, even without possessions, you possess true wealth.' Therefore, one should not create opportunities for increasing desires related to one's body or possessions.",
    "<8><177> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nTherefore, one should not create opportunities to obtain even small amounts of food, clothing, and ornaments for the sake of increasing one's body's desires. The excellences of a person who is detached from the body and possessions, who has few desires and is content, are inexhaustible. Such a person will never experience the anxiety of lacking resources. Whatever object that is difficult to obtain and valuable, one should not consider it as supreme and desirable, but be content with whatever is available. Not grasping at attractive things that cause attachment is the supreme among all riches—this is the excellent substance.\n\nSuch enjoyment of possessions is a good thing because initially it is easy to acquire, in the middle it is easy to protect due to lack of attachment, and it is beneficial when enjoyed. Finally, when separated from it through loss, it does not generate regret or suffering, similar things are easy to obtain again, and even at the time of death, one has no attachment. As stated in the Letter to a Friend: 'Among all wealth, contentment is supreme, as taught by the divine teacher. Always practice contentment. If you know contentment, even without possessions, you have perfect wealth.'\n\nTherefore, contentment is the common treasure of the noble ones. Without it, if one has great attachment, there are countless stories such as the monk who was attached to his alms bowl and was reborn as a snake, one who was attached to Dharma robes and was reborn as a spirit, and a small child who was attached to a woolen garment and was reborn as a hungry ghost. The second section has two parts: showing that attachment is inappropriate due to the body's inferior nature, and due to not knowing what is beneficial and harmful. If one thinks, 'Although one should not be attached to enjoyments, it is reasonable to be attached to the body,' this is not the case.",

The body itself has no inherent value unless it's used for Dharma practice. It is inert and must be moved by the mind, yet we mistakenly identify with it.\n\n**'What use to me is this mechanical contraption of a body?'**\nThe body is compared to an automatic machine or contraption, emphasizing its mechanical nature and lack of independent agency. Being merely a collection of impure aggregates, it is a source of many unbearable sufferings. There is no intrinsic need for this body, as it will ultimately turn to dust and disappear.\n\n**'What difference is there between this body and a clod of earth or a piece of firewood?'**\nThis line questions what truly distinguishes our physical form from any other insentient object like earth or wood. Without being applied to Dharma practice, the body is essentially no different from these inanimate objects. Both the body and these objects lack inherent existence and will eventually disintegrate.\n\n**'Alas! Mind, why do you not dispel the pride thinking 'this is me' or 'this is my body'?'**\nThis final line laments our failure to overcome our pride and ego-clinging. Due to unbearable craving and attachment to the body, we develop arrogance arising from identification with it.

With attachment towards those on one's own side and anger towards enemies, what purpose is there in being attached to and protecting this body, which is merely comparable to a rotten piece of wood?

Since the body itself experiences neither attachment to what benefits it nor aversion to what harms it—having no preference between being carefully nourished or being consumed by scavengers—for what reason, then, should I cling to and become attached to this body? This body does not recognize benefit or harm, so it is not reasonable for me to be attached to something that remains indifferent to its own fate.

    "<9><1> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse states: 'All these components, the Sage taught for the sake of wisdom. Therefore, those who wish to pacify suffering should cultivate wisdom.'\n\nAll these components or factors mentioned above—from generosity through meditation, comprising the first five perfections—were taught by the Sage, the Buddha Bhagavān, primarily for the sake of generating wisdom, the sixth perfection. These methods in all their aspects serve as companions or supports for wisdom, just as a king going to battle is accompanied by his army divisions.\n\nAs stated in the Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā: 'Just as all rivers flow into and accompany the Ganges on its journey to the great ocean, likewise, the five perfections, when guided by the perfection of wisdom, proceed to omniscience.' Similarly, the Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra teaches: 'With a mind in equipoise, one will see reality as it truly is.'\n\nTherefore, those who wish to pacify completely all the sufferings of saṃsāra for themselves and others should diligently generate the wisdom that realizes suchness. All sufferings arise from contaminated karma and afflictive emotions, which in turn stem from grasping at entities as inherently existent. As the Yuktiṣaṣṭikā states: 'When there is acceptance of entities as inherently existent, unbearable attachment and hatred arise.'\n\nBy realizing emptiness, one not only pacifies one's own suffering but also naturally develops compassion for others. The Bodhicittavivaraṇa states: 'Thus when yogis become accustomed to emptiness, their minds effortlessly develop delight in benefiting others.' By teaching emptiness to others as well, one helps dispel their suffering too.\n\nThis section begins the explanation of wisdom, which has several parts: establishing the two truths, practicing meditation, cutting through misconceptions with reasoning, and understanding the function of realizing emptiness. The first part deals with the divisions of the two truths, their characteristics, and the persons who establish them.",
    "<9><2> Combined Commentary on 'The Two Truths'\n\n**Verse 1-2: 'Conventional and ultimate: these are accepted as the two truths.'**\n\nAll phenomena encompassed by saṃsāra and nirvāṇa have two aspects: conventional truth (saṃvṛti-satya), which is the mere appearance of phenomena in their multiplicity as they appear; and ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya), which is emptiness, the true nature of phenomena as they actually are. As the Sutra of the Meeting of Father and Son states: 'Thus, the Tathāgata comprehends both conventional and ultimate truths. All that is to be known is exhausted in these two truths.' These are accepted as the two truths because each is non-deceptive from its respective perspective.\n\nThe knowable objects, when divided, are definitely established as just these two truths. The nature of this division is: conventional truth is the object found by conventional valid cognition, while ultimate truth is the object found by ultimate valid cognition. These truths possess the characteristic of being neither identical nor different, as explained in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. If they were essentially different, phenomena would become truly existent; if they were not different at all, other faults would apply. Thus, they are of one essence but conceptually distinct, like produced phenomena and impermanence.\n\n**Verse 3-4: 'Ultimate is not the domain of intellect; intellect is said to be conventional.'**\n\nThe ultimate reality transcends all extremes of existence, non-existence, both, or neither. Hence, it is not an object of conceptual mind or dualistic consciousness. Relative truth (kunzob) refers to deluded cognitions that obscure true reality, while ultimate truth (döndam) is the non-conceptual wisdom of the noble ones and the object realized by that wisdom.\n\nAs stated in a sūtra: 'Divine son, if ultimate truth were to become an object of bodily, verbal, or mental activity, it would not be counted as ultimate but would become conventional truth. Divine son, however, ultimate truth transcends all conventions, is truly unborn, unceased, beyond what is to be expressed and what expresses, beyond what is to be known and what knows.'\n\nHere, 'intellect' or 'cognition' refers to conceptual thought, which is ignorance, and therefore ultimate truth is not its object. Being the mind and mental factors of the three realms, it is conventional truth. However, this does not mean that ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge at all. Those who explain this verse as meaning that ultimate truth cannot be realized by any consciousness are mistaken.\n\nWhen it is said that the true nature is not an object of knowledge, this means it transcends all conceptual elaborations and cannot be apprehended by the mind as an object with dualistic appearance. Yet conventionally speaking, it is appropriate to say that the true nature is an object of knowledge, in the sense that it is the object for the meditative equipoise of the noble ones. As stated in the Sūtra Dispelling Ajātaśatru's Remorse: 'Great king, not seeing any phenomena is true seeing. Great king, true seeing is non-seeing.'\n\nTherefore, the first line indicates the characteristic of ultimate truth, and the second line indicates the characteristic of conventional truth. Both instances of 'intellect' refer to dualistic consciousness, not consciousness in general. Ultimate truth is realized by non-dual wisdom, while conventional truth is known through the dualistic appearances of ordinary consciousness.",
    "<9><3> Combined Commentary\n\n**In relation to the verse 'In this regard, the world is seen as twofold: the yogic and the ordinary. In this context, the ordinary world is refuted by the yogic world,'** we can understand this as follows:\n\nThe 'world' here refers to beings or individuals designated in dependence upon the aggregates. These are seen in two ways: yogis and ordinary people. Yogis possess the meditative concentration unifying śamatha and vipaśyanā (tranquility and insight) and realize that all phenomena are empty of inherent nature. Ordinary people, by contrast, assert the existence of inherently existent entities. This division primarily refers to these two categories, though those who understand emptiness through hearing and contemplation should be included among yogis, and those whose minds have not been influenced by philosophical tenets should be included among ordinary people.\n\nWithin the ordinary world, there are two categories: those whose minds have not been influenced by philosophical tenets and those whose minds have been so influenced. The first type, from beginningless time, conceives of an 'I' as existing and views the body as a single whole entity and the mind as permanent. The second type includes non-Buddhist outsiders who, though they have many divisions, can be condensed into two views: eternalism and nihilism.\n\nThe claims of these ordinary people are invalidated by the yogic world of Buddhism, whose reasoning shows that 'the body is not a single entity because it possesses many parts,' and 'the mind is impermanent because it undergoes change,' and so forth. These ordinary views are refuted by the various Buddhist arguments against eternalism and nihilism.\n\nFurthermore, even among yogis, the three schools—the External Realists (Vaibhāṣikas and Sautrāntikas), Mind-Only adherents (Cittamātrins), and Madhyamikas—each refute those below them. The reasoning of higher systems refutes the apparent objects of the assertions of lower systems.\n\nThe two Realist schools view indivisible particles as objects and momentary consciousness as subjects as ultimately real. The Mind-Only school refutes this with reasoning: 'When six particles are joined together simultaneously, the subtle particle would have six parts. If these six occupy the same space, even a mass would be only the size of a single particle.' This demonstrates that since constituent particles cannot be established, gross objects cannot be established either.\n\nThe Mind-Only proponents view non-dual consciousness—self-cognizing and self-illuminating—as ultimately real. The Madhyamikas refute this through reasonings that negate self-cognition, as will be explained later in the text.\n\nEven among yogis who realize emptiness, those dwelling on higher grounds (second and above) refute—or outshine—those dwelling on lower grounds. In terms of a single mental continuum, the higher grounds, through their deeper understanding, refute the uneliminated seeds of cognitive obscurations present on the lower grounds.\n\nThe purpose of this explanation is to establish with certainty that there are two types of cognition: cognition realizing conventional truth and cognition realizing ultimate truth. The cognition realizing ultimate truth refutes all extremist views.",
    "<9><4> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn this context, we must understand the issue of how different philosophical systems and levels of realization relate to one another. The verse addresses both the hierarchical nature of understanding among practitioners and the purpose of practice despite the ultimate lack of inherent existence.\n\nFirst, regarding yogic practitioners, there exists a hierarchy of understanding wherein 'through distinctions in their understanding of the true nature of reality, the higher ones refute and overcome the lower ones' philosophical assertions.' This includes ordinary worldly people who believe in indivisible atoms and momentary consciousness, as well as yogis of various philosophical schools. The Madhyamikas refute Cittamātrins who assert consciousness as truly existent, Cittamātrins refute Sautrāntikas who accept indivisible atoms, and those of higher grounds refute the understanding of those on lower grounds.\n\nFor example, the two schools asserting external objects (Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika) view indivisible particles as objects and momentary consciousness as subjects to be ultimately real. The Mind-Only school refutes this with reasoning such as: 'When six particles are simultaneously conjoined, the subtle particle becomes six-fold. If the six occupy the same space, even a collection would be the size of a single particle.' The Madhyamikas, in turn, refute the Mind-Only assertion that non-dual consciousness—self-cognizing and self-illuminating—is ultimate reality.\n\nThe second part of the verse addresses a common objection: 'If all phenomena lack inherent existence, what is the purpose of training in the path of generosity and so forth? Wouldn't it be pointless, like purchasing an illusory horse?' The answer is that 'both Madhyamikas and substantialists accept examples like dreams and illusions' which are conventionally known to be false. Through these commonly accepted examples, one can demonstrate that forms and all phenomena, while appearing, lack inherent nature.\n\nTherefore, 'although generosity and so forth are not truly established, one engages in them with wisdom that understands them as illusory and unexamined, for the sake of attaining the result of Buddhahood.' One practices these 'merely for the sake of the result or purpose, without analytical investigation.' This approach allows practitioners to work toward the benefit and happiness of self and others without clinging to the path and result as truly existent, just as one might conjure an illusory army to escape real enemies, or seek a remedy for suffering experienced in a dream.\n\nIn conclusion, both conventional and ultimate perspectives have their place: conventionally we engage in virtuous practices for the sake of results, while ultimately we understand these very practices and results to be without inherent existence.",
    "<9><5> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འཇིག་རྟེན་པ་ཡིས་དངོས་མཐོང་ཞིང་། །' (Ordinary worldly people perceive phenomenal objects)\nWhen perceiving objects, ordinary worldly people see phenomenal objects like forms and other sense objects that are established by valid cognition. This perception itself is not being disputed, as both Madhyamikas and Realists agree that appearances are perceived by the senses.\n\n'ཡང་དག་ཉིད་དུའང་རྟོག་བྱེད་ཀྱི། །' (And conceptualize them as truly real)\nHowever, ordinary people go beyond mere perception and conceptualize these appearances as truly or ultimately established. They fail to understand phenomena as empty of true existence, believing that if things exist, they must inherently exist. This is where the fundamental misunderstanding lies.\n\n'སྒྱུ་མ་ལྟ་བུར་མིན་པས་འདིར། །' (Not as being like illusions, therefore here)\nUnlike yogis (Madhyamikas), ordinary people do not see or realize appearances as unreal and illusory. Although both see the same appearances, yogis understand that phenomena are like dreams or illusions—they appear but lack inherent existence. Yogis engage with phenomena with wisdom that comprehends them as unanalyzed, false, and illusion-like, enabling practices such as generosity to be meaningful even while recognizing their lack of inherent existence.\n\n'རྣལ་འབྱོར་པ་དང་འཇིག་རྟེན་རྩོད། །' (There is a dispute between yogis and ordinary worldly people)\nTherefore, the dispute between yogis and ordinary people is not about whether phenomena appear or exist conventionally, but about how they exist. The Realists who hold the two truths as contradictory think that if things do not inherently exist, they must not exist at all. This mistaken view leads to objections that the absence of inherent existence contradicts direct perception. In reality, the Madhyamika position accommodates both the conventional existence of phenomena and their ultimate emptiness of inherent nature.",
    "<9><6> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse explains that form and other phenomena, even when supposedly established by direct perception, are merely conventionally accepted but not ultimately valid. Even direct perception itself is established only by worldly convention without critical examination, not by genuine valid cognition when analyzed. As the Samādhirāja Sūtra clearly states: 'Eyes, ears, and nose are not valid means of knowledge; tongue, body, and mind are also not valid cognition'—teaching that sense faculties cannot access ultimate reality. If sensory perception were truly valid regarding ultimate nature, ordinary beings would perceive ultimate reality directly, making the noble path unnecessary.\n\nThese conventional perceptions are false in the same way that a woman's body, which is actually impure and impermanent, is conventionally regarded as pure and permanent. This example demonstrates how conventional understanding can be completely contrary to reality. If one objects that forms must exist inherently because the Buddha taught about aggregates, elements, and sense bases as existing with characteristics like impermanence, the response is that such teachings are of interpretable meaning (neyārtha) with hidden intention. The basis of the Buddha's intention when teaching impermanence was merely referring to the way things appear conventionally, not their ultimate nature.",
    "<9><7> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'འཇིག་རྟེན་གཞུག་པའི་དོན་དུ་ནི། །' (For the purpose of leading worldly beings)\nFor the purpose of gradually guiding ordinary beings who are attached to substantialism and are unable to realize emptiness directly, the Buddha taught the impermanence of phenomena as a skillful means to lead them step by step into the authentic Middle Way path.\n\n'མགོན་པོས་དངོས་བསྟན་དེ་ཉིད་དུ། །' (The Protector taught in terms of reality)\nThe Protector of all living beings, the Perfect Buddha, taught that material forms and other phenomena exist and are impermanent. This teaching was similar to what is stated elsewhere: 'The Buddha's teachings about self and mine were spoken with an intentional purpose; likewise, the teachings on aggregates, elements, and sense bases were also spoken with an intentional purpose.'\n\n'དེ་དག་སྐད་ཅིག་མ་ཉིད་མིན། །' (Those are not actually momentary)\nIn terms of ultimate reality (tattva), those aggregates and phenomena are not established as momentary, because when analyzed, they are neither established as singular nor multiple, and are without arising or cessation. They are refuted by the reasoning that analyzes momentariness at the ultimate level.\n\n'ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཏུ་ཡང་འགལ་ཞེ་ན། །' (If one objects that this contradicts conventional reality as well)\nIf one objects: 'If momentariness is not ultimate truth, then establishing it as conventional truth (saṃvṛti) is also contradictory because moments are not apparent to ordinary worldly beings,' the response is that although impermanence might not be directly perceived by ordinary people, it is established by the conventional valid cognition of yogic practitioners who have at least seen the selflessness of persons. Thus, there is no fault in establishing conditioned phenomena as impermanent conventionally.",
    "<9><8> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'རྣལ་འབྱོར་ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཉེས་མེད་དེ། །' (There is no fault in the conventional [truth] of the yogis.)\n\nThis line explains that the 'yogic convention' - the way yogis perceive conventional reality - is faultless. While ordinary people with untrained minds corrupted by deceptive causes do not recognize objects like jars as momentary or impermanent, yogis who have cultivated proper contemplation can perceive and ascertain the momentary nature of phenomena correctly. This yogic perception is a valid form of conventional understanding that sees things as they truly are conventionally.\n\n'འཇིག་རྟེན་ལ་ལྟོས་དེ་ཉིད་མཐོང་། །' (With respect to worldly [understanding], they see reality.)\n\nCompared to ordinary worldly consciousness that grasps things as permanent, pure, or pleasurable, yogis see 'reality' or 'suchness' (de nyid) because they perceive conventional truth as it actually is. This doesn't mean yogis see ultimate reality in all respects, but relative to ordinary worldly perception, their understanding is closer to how things actually exist. Their perception of impermanence is established through valid yogic conventional cognition, which is superior to ordinary worldly understanding.\n\n'གཞན་དུ་བུད་མེད་མི་གཙང་བར། །' (Otherwise, [regarding] women as impure.)\n\nThis line introduces a specific example: If we were to claim that ordinary worldly perception was valid or authoritative compared to yogic perception, we would face a contradiction. When a yogi who has cultivated meditation on unattractiveness realizes a woman's body as impure (as it actually is conventionally), this would be invalidated by ordinary people's conception of women as pure.\n\n'དེས་རྟོགས་འཇིག་རྟེན་གྱིས་གནོད་འགྱུར། །' (Their realization would be contradicted by worldly [views].)\n\nThis concludes the example, stating that if ordinary worldly perception were considered the standard of truth, then the yogi's correct realization of impurity would be contradicted by worldly misconceptions. However, this is not the case, because the yogi's perception of impurity accurately refutes the ordinary misconception of purity, while the reverse cannot occur. The superior yogic perception cannot be invalidated by inferior ordinary perception. This example serves to counter objections about the emptiness teachings, which some critics claim would undermine the possibility of generating merit through offerings to the Buddha.",
    "<9><9> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n'From Buddha-like illusion comes merit, how is this possible in reality? If sentient beings are like illusions, then after death, how can they be reborn?'\n\nThis verse addresses two objections to the emptiness view. For the first objection: From Buddhas who are 'like magical illusions' (meaning they lack inherent existence), by making offerings to them, merit arises that is also like an illusion. This is just as our opponents accept that from making real offerings to what they consider a truly existent Buddha, real merit arises. Whether the Buddha and merit are established as truly existent or merely as illusion-like appearances, merit still functions in accordance with its object. There is no contradiction in merit arising merely because we claim the Buddha lacks true existence.\n\nFor the second objection: If sentient beings are like illusions, free from true existence, then how can they take rebirth after death, when illusions, once ceased, do not reappear? The response is that we have not claimed sentient beings and illusions are similar in all respects—only that they both lack true establishment. This similarity in one aspect doesn't entail similarity in all functions. If our opponent claims this creates a problem, then their own position faces similar difficulties, as they too must explain how appearances that they accept as false (like dreams) function in certain ways but not others.",
    "<9><10> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n**ཇི་སྲིད་རྐྱེན་རྣམས་འཚོགས་གྱུར་པ། ། (As long as the collection of conditions exists,)**\n\nAs long as the collection of conditions, such as substances, mantras and other necessary elements, exists and comes together, these conditions form an assemblage that serves as the basis for appearances to arise. This is similar to how the conditions for magical illusions require specific elements to be gathered together.\n\n**དེ་སྲིད་སྒྱུ་མའང་འབྱུང་བར་འགྱུར། ། (To that extent even the illusion will arise.)**\n\nTo that same extent, illusory appearances such as magical horses, oxen, and other apparitions will manifest. Similarly, when conditions such as karma and afflictions like ignorance come together, the appearances of sentient beings and their connections between lives will continue to arise without interruption, just as an illusory display manifests when its conditions are assembled.\n\n**རྒྱུན་རིང་ཙམ་གྱིས་ཇི་ལྟར་ན། ། (How could it be that merely by a long continuum,)**\n\nOne might object: 'This comparison is not equivalent because sentient beings have existed with a long continuum since beginningless time, while magical illusions are momentary.' However, the equivalence is not based on duration but on their nature of appearing while being empty of true existence. How could sentient beings truly exist merely because of having a long continuum? If true existence were determined by duration, then long-lasting illusions would become truly existent, while momentarily appearing sentient beings would not truly exist.\n\n**སེམས་ཅན་བདེན་པར་ཡོད་པ་ཡིན། ། (Sentient beings truly exist?)**\n\nSentient beings do not truly exist simply because their continuum is long. This would lead to the absurd consequence that we would have to accept distinctions between truth and falsity based merely on varying durations of phenomena like illusions and dreams. For instance, we would have to consider a dream that includes memories spanning an eon as more 'real' than a dream of a single day. Furthermore, this comparison to illusions does not negate that there are real consequences to actions—the objection that 'if sentient beings are like illusions, there would be no virtue in benefiting them nor sin in harming them' will be addressed in the subsequent verses.",
    "<9><11> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nEven if one were to kill a magical person or harm them in other ways, motivated by the intention to kill, since these magically-created beings lack a mind that experiences pleasure and pain (which would serve as a basis for benefit or harm), no actual sin of killing arises beyond the mere fault of negative mental engagement. If one perceives a magical creation as human and strikes it with a weapon out of the desire to kill, there would be the negativity of the preparatory action, but there is no negativity of the main act of killing because there is no mind in that magical person.\n\nHowever, in relation to sentient beings who possess minds that are like illusions, both merit and sin arise from benefiting or harming them. From benefiting sentient beings who possess minds, such as humans and other beings with illusory minds, merit arises; and from harming them, negativity arises.\n\nThus, although there is a distinction between whether sentient beings exist or not, there is no difference regarding whether they are real or false. When sentient beings possessing minds that are like illusions perform actions, since the agent has a mind with love, hatred, and so forth, merit and sin arise. One might think, 'Sentient beings have minds, therefore they are unlike illusions and are not the same as real or false,' but although sentient beings do have minds, those minds themselves are like illusions, so how could that make them real?",
    "<9><12> Combined Commentary\n\nThis verse explains that mantras, substances, and other magical elements do not have the capacity to produce consciousness; therefore, an illusory mind cannot arise in magical displays like illusory horses or oxen. Unlike the causes of sentient beings, which do have the power to generate mind, magical substances lack this capability. The various magical illusions that arise from different conditions appear in diverse forms—this diversity applies not just to sentient beings but to all phenomena.\n\nThe text emphasizes that various and dissimilar illusions arise from various and dissimilar conditions. Though both sentient beings and magical illusions might be ultimately false from the Mādhyamika perspective, they differ in their conventional appearances based on their different causes. This demonstrates an important principle: no single cause or condition has the power to produce all possible effects anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Mādhyamika position accepts that in ultimate reality there is no arising, aging, and so forth, and that emptiness of inherent existence is the natural nirvāṇa. Yet conventionally, it acknowledges that arising, aging, and other phenomena established through karma and afflictions constitute saṃsāra. This distinction between conventional appearance and ultimate reality is crucial for understanding the nature of both illusions and sentient beings.",
    "<9><13> Combined Commentary on Verse\n\n'གལ་ཏེ་དོན་དམ་མྱ་ངན་འདས། །འཁོར་བ་ཀུན་རྫོབ་དེ་ལྟ་ན། །སངས་རྒྱས་ཀྱང་ནི་འཁོར་འགྱུར་བས། །བྱང་ཆུབ་སྤྱོད་པས་ཅི་ཞིག་བྱ། །'\n\nThis verse presents an objection raised by those who hold nirvāṇa to be a real, inherently existing entity. They argue: 'If ultimate truth is nirvāṇa, while saṃsāra is merely conventional truth, then even the Buddha would cycle in saṃsāra, so what would be the purpose of engaging in bodhisattva conduct?'\n\nThe objectors reason that if all phenomena of saṃsāra are ultimately free from inherent nature (and thus nirvāṇa), while saṃsāra with its characteristics of birth, aging, sickness, and death continues to exist conventionally, then nirvāṇa and saṃsāra would share a common basis. By this logic, if all sentient beings have inherently transcended suffering from the ultimate perspective, yet conventionally they exist in saṃsāra, then the same would apply to Buddhas—they too would cycle in saṃsāra from the perspective of conventional appearances.\n\nThis would absurdly render the bodhisattva path meaningless, as the objectors ask: 'What is the purpose of engaging in bodhisattva conduct to attain buddhahood if buddhahood doesn't actually free one from saṃsāra on the conventional level?'\n\nHowever, this objection is unfounded. There is an important distinction between natural purity nirvāṇa (the ultimate nature) and adventitious stain-free nirvāṇa (the realization that eliminates afflictions). Although different causes produce different effects, there is no difference between them in terms of being ultimately true or false—like illusory horses and cattle that appear differently yet are equally unreal. The continued appearance of saṃsāra depends on uninterrupted conditions, and when those conditions are removed through the bodhisattva path, liberation is achieved.",
    "<9><14> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn this verse, the distinction between natural nirvana and adventitious pure nirvana is being addressed. Natural nirvana is the inherent state of all phenomena regardless of whether beings recognize it, while adventitious stainless nirvana must be attained through interrupting the causes of cyclic existence.\n\nThe verse explains that 'if the conditions that give rise to the appearance of distinct phenomena are uninterrupted,' meaning if the causes and conditions that perpetuate samsara continue without cessation, 'then not only samsara but even magical illusions and their appearances will not cease.' Just as an illusion persists as long as its causal conditions remain intact, sentient beings remain bound in the cycle of existence when ignorance and other causes remain unbroken.\n\nConversely, 'when these conditions are interrupted,' particularly when ignorance, the fundamental cause of rebirth, is uprooted through the wisdom realizing selflessness, 'conventional appearances do not arise' - meaning that samsara ceases even on the conventional level. The phrase 'even conventionally' implies that ultimate non-arising need not even be mentioned, as it is already established.\n\nThis addresses the objection that after attaining Buddhahood one might return to samsara. For Buddhas, the continuity of conditions that would cause samsara has been completely severed, so there is no possibility of returning to cyclic existence. The Buddhas' appearances in the world arise from their aspirations and the merit of sentient beings, not from causal conditions that perpetuate samsara. Though they may display activities like magical illusions through the power of their wisdom, aspirations, and meditative concentrations, they never move from the dharmadhātu (ultimate reality).\n\nThis verse also begins to address the Cittamātrin position, which will be refuted in subsequent verses.",
    "<9><15> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'When there is not even an illusion, by what is the magical illusion perceived?'\n\nThis verse presents an objection: If all phenomena lack inherent existence, and if even the deluded consciousness that apprehends illusion does not exist, then by what means could illusion be perceived? The objection assumes that without a perceiver of illusion, illusion itself would become non-existent, reflecting the assumption that whatever exists must exist inherently.\n\n'If at the time when you yourself do not even have a magical illusion-like object, what object is perceived at that time?'\n\nHere, the verse turns the objection back on the opponent (the Cittamātra or Mind-Only school): When for you Cittamātrins, if objects appearing as external referents are not established as they appear, then according to your view they would lack inherent existence and thus must be non-existent. If the appearing objects that are like illusions do not exist, then what object could be perceived? This shows that the objection applies equally to both sides.\n\nThis forms part of a broader response that has multiple sections: showing how the objection applies equally to the opponent, refuting their response, and applying the point to the context. The verse reveals that the Cittamātrins face the same problem they pose to others - if illusion-like appearances lack true existence, then what exactly is being apprehended?",
    "<9><16> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n**གལ་ཏེ་དེ་ཉིད་དུ་གཞན་ཡོད། །** (If there is something else existing as such itself...)\n\nThe opponent objects: 'Even though objects appearing as external entities do not exist as they appear, they exist in another way. Although the objective aspect has no intrinsic reality as an external material entity, something still exists in its place—the objective aspect that appears is actually consciousness itself, not an external object.' This is the Cittamātra position that maintains objects are not completely non-existent but are manifestations of mind itself, similar to horses and elephants appearing in dreams.\n\n**རྣམ་པ་དེ་ནི་སེམས་ཉིད་ཡིན། །** (That aspect is mind itself.)\n\nThe objector continues: 'These aspects of form and so forth are actually the substance of mind itself. What appears as objects is actually consciousness.' The Cittamātra proponent suggests that the objective aspects that appear are substantially identical with the mind, not external objects occupying a separate ontological position. They claim these appearances are the mind itself manifesting in various forms.\n\n**གང་ཚེ་སེམས་ཉིད་སྒྱུ་མ་ན། །** (When mind itself is like an illusion...)\n\nWhen that consciousness itself is illusory-like, appearing as objective aspects rather than as external entities, then what remains? When mind itself appears as illusory objects, the duality of perceiver and perceived becomes problematic. If consciousness is identical with its objects, then consciousness itself becomes illusory like the objects it supposedly projects.\n\n**དེ་ཚེ་གང་ཞིག་གང་གིས་མཐོང་། །** (Then, what is seen by what?)\n\nSince both object and subject are identical (being the same consciousness), what consciousness, devoid of a separate object, can be perceived and by what valid cognition? What object is seen by which subject? As the Buddha taught in sutras like the Laṅkāvatāra: 'Just as a sword's blade cannot cut itself, and just as a fingertip cannot touch itself, likewise, mind cannot perceive mind.' Perception requires duality—if there is no duality because everything is mind, then perception becomes impossible. Without a true distinction between perceiver and perceived, seeing cannot occur.",
    "<9><17> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse states: 'Even the Protector of the World has declared, 'The mind cannot see the mind.' Just as a sword's edge cannot cut itself, so too the mind [cannot perceive itself].'\n\nThe Protector of the World—the Buddha, who protects all worldly beings—has taught this principle in both the Lankavatara Sutra and the Ratna-cūḍa Sūtra. When the mind itself is considered as an object, like an illusion, the fundamental question arises: what can be seen by whom? Since there is no true duality of perceiver and perceived within a single consciousness, self-perception becomes impossible.\n\nThe text provides a powerful analogy: just as the edge of a sword cannot cut itself, the mind cannot perceive itself. Additional examples include how a fingertip cannot touch itself and how a swift-footed person cannot ride on their own shoulders. All these examples illustrate the same principle—an entity cannot act upon itself in this direct manner.\n\nThose who accept self-cognition (rang rig), particularly the Cittamātra school, argue that consciousness naturally knows itself, just as a lamp illuminates both external objects and itself without needing another light source. However, this position leads to logical contradictions. If the apprehending aspect knows itself without any distinction between knower and known, they must accept them as a single entity without even conceptually distinct aspects. This would mean accepting absurdities such as a sword edge cutting itself or valid cognition functioning without dependence on what is to be measured.\n\nThe fundamental point is that once the mind is established as truly existent, any division into observer and observed within a partless mind becomes untenable. Whatever appears as an object is not the mind itself, and what does not appear cannot be properly apprehended. Therefore, in ultimate reality, what is called 'self-cognition of consciousness' is merely a conventional designation rather than an ultimate truth.",
    "<9><18> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nJust as a lamp illuminates its own nature clearly, so too, some claim, consciousness apprehends both itself and other objects. However, this example is not established. A lamp does not need to illuminate itself because, from the very moment it arises, it is not obscured by darkness—it is already clear by nature. What need is there to illuminate something that is already visible? As stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: 'Where a lamp is present, there is no darkness. What does the lamp illuminate? For illumination means dispelling darkness.'\n\nIf a lamp could perform an action upon itself, then darkness would also obscure itself. In that case, when darkness obscures itself as an obstacle to seeing objects like pots, those pots would paradoxically become visible, which is absurd. Furthermore, if a lamp could illuminate without an object to illuminate, then this lamp would also illuminate the sun and moon, which is clearly unacceptable.\n\nThe Cittamātrins argue that self-cognition exists naturally, comparing it to blue beryl which is naturally blue without dependence on external conditions, unlike white crystal which turns blue depending on a blue cloth beneath it. However, this analogy fails.\n\nJust as the edge of a sword cannot cut itself, a fingertip cannot touch itself, and a rider cannot ride on his own shoulders, similarly, the mind cannot see itself. As the Ratna-cūḍa-sūtra states: 'Just as the edge of a sword cannot cut itself, and a fingertip cannot touch itself, likewise, the mind cannot see itself.' Once the mind is established as truly existent, a single, partless entity cannot be both subject and object of perception simultaneously. Therefore, in ultimate reality, even what is called 'self-cognition of consciousness' is merely a conventional designation and not ultimately valid.",

Just as clear crystal turns blue depending on something external like cloth placed underneath it, while blue lapis lazuli is presumed to be inherently and definitively blue by its own nature without depending on other conditions. Similarly, the verse suggests that we observe both phenomena that depend on others (such as objects that need illumination) and phenomena that do not depend on others (such as self-awareness or self-luminosity).\n\nHowever, this example is fundamentally flawed. The assertion that lapis lazuli's blueness exists independent of other factors is incorrect. Its appearance as blue is actually produced by various causal conditions, just like any other blue object. Lapis lazuli cannot, by its own power, transform from a previously non-blue state to a blue state, as this would constitute self-causation, which is contradictory. Even though lapis lazuli appears blue from the moment we perceive it, this doesn't mean its blueness is self-established or independent of causes and conditions.\n\nThe underlying argument attempting to establish self-cognition or self-awareness through this example fails because nothing, including blueness itself, can exist independently of causes and conditions. This refutes the notion that consciousness can be self-cognizing without depending on any other cognizing agent, just as a lamp cannot illuminate itself, as that would entail the absurd consequence that darkness could obscure itself, making obscured objects visible.",
    "<9><20> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThe verse 'སྔོ་ཉིད་མིན་ལ་སྔོན་པོར་དེ། །བདག་གིས་བདག་ཉིད་བྱས་པ་མེད། །' is being explained sentence by sentence:\n\nSome philosophers argue that for certain objects, there is a mutually dependent relationship between the illuminated and the illuminator (like form and visual consciousness), or that consciousness possesses self-awareness by its own nature without requiring an external cognizer. To illustrate this point, they often use the example of lapis lazuli, claiming it is blue by its own nature without depending on anything else, in contrast to a white crystal that appears blue due to its substrate.\n\nHowever, this verse refutes this example. The blue beryl or lapis lazuli itself does not exist as inherently blue independent of other factors. Rather, its appearance as blue is produced by a collection of causes and conditions. \n\nThe verse specifically states that something that was not originally blue cannot make itself blue through its own agency. If something were to arise as non-blue from its causes, then for it to become blue, it would have to transform itself without depending on other conditions—it would need to make itself blue by itself. This is impossible because it is contradictory for something to act upon itself.\n\nThe underlying principle is that nothing can be the agent of its own production or transformation, as this would entail the logical contradiction of something acting upon itself before it fully exists in that state.",
    "<9><21> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFor example, some philosophers argue that there are two types of illumination: (1) mutual dependence between illuminated and illuminator (like form and visual consciousness), and (2) self-illumination that naturally occurs without depending on mutual distinction, such as self-awareness. They often use the analogy of blue lapis lazuli as something that is blue by its own nature without depending on other factors, comparing it to crystal which appears blue only due to external influence.\n\nHowever, this example of lapis lazuli being naturally blue without arising from other causes is untenable. In reality, the blue lapis lazuli is not blue independently; rather, its blue appearance is produced by collections of causes and conditions. If something were not initially blue and then had to make itself blue by its own nature, this would be impossible.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that something cannot act upon itself - it is contradictory for an entity to be both the agent and object of the same action. If the blue arose from its own cause as something that was not originally blue, then it would need to make itself blue without depending on other conditions, which is logically impossible. This contradiction undermines the analogy used to support self-cognition.",
    "<9><22> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse is examining the claim that 'consciousness is self-illuminating' by comparing it to a lamp.\n\n'When we say 'the lamp illuminates,' this is known by a consciousness different from the lamp itself—a consciousness that perceives objects—and then expressed through language. However, if consciousness itself is claimed to be self-cognizant or self-illuminating, we must ask: by which consciousness is this known, such that one can make this assertion? Is the knower of consciousness's self-illumination the consciousness itself, or a different consciousness?\n\nIf consciousness knows its own self-illuminating nature, this would be circular reasoning, as the very issue under examination is whether consciousness can know itself. If instead consciousness's self-illumination must be known by another consciousness, this leads to an infinite regress of knowers, making knowledge ultimately impossible.\n\nFurthermore, if a lamp doesn't actually illuminate itself but rather other objects, and we simply use the convention 'the lamp illuminates' based on our awareness of this illumination of objects, then similarly, consciousness itself cannot be self-illuminating. If consciousness's luminosity requires verification by some other substantial awareness, then who could know this and make such a statement?\n\nUltimately, the example (lamp) and what it's meant to illustrate (self-illuminating consciousness) are not equivalent. Conventionally we might speak of a lamp illuminating based on our perception and verbal conventions, but the fundamental question remains: who ultimately cognizes and then asserts that 'consciousness is self-illuminating'?'",
    "<9><23> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, when that dependent consciousness is not seen by itself, nor is it seen by others (meaning it is not observed by any mind in the ultimate sense), then examining whether it is 'manifest' or 'unmanifest' ('luminous' or 'non-luminous') is utterly meaningless. This is because the subject of perception is not established by valid cognition in the first place. Establishing qualifying attributes for a subject that has never been perceived is exactly like describing the posture, gait, or graceful movements of a barren woman's daughter as 'beautiful' or 'not beautiful.' Just as a barren woman's daughter is an impossibility, speaking of her manner of walking or appearance is pointless - even if such descriptions are expressed, they have absolutely no meaning. This third section continues by demonstrating how memory can arise even without self-awareness, and will refute the claim that without self-awareness, awareness of other objects would be impossible.",
    "<9><24> Combined Commentary Explanation:\n\nགལ་ཏེ་རང་རིག་ཡོད་མིན་ན། །རྣམ་ཤེས་དྲན་པར་ཇི་ལྟར་འགྱུར། །\n(If self-awareness did not exist, how would consciousness be remembered?)\n\nHere, the Cittamātrins, having failed to establish self-awareness through direct valid cognition, attempt to prove its existence through inference. They argue that without self-awareness, we could not remember our previous consciousness. Their reasoning is that just as we remember previously experienced objects like blue, we also clearly remember the consciousness that apprehended blue. Without prior self-cognition, they claim, such recollection would be impossible, like an effect without a cause. If one remembers 'I previously saw blue,' the memory of both the object (blue) and the subject (the seeing consciousness) indicates that both must have been experienced previously.\n\nགཞན་མྱོང་བ་དང་འབྲེལ་པ་ལས། །དྲན་འགྱུར་བྱི་བའི་དུག་བཞིན་ནོ། །\n(It is remembered from the relationship with experiencing other things, just like rat poison.)\n\nThis verse presents the Mādhyamika response, explaining that remembering consciousness does not establish self-awareness. When blue-perception experiences the external object blue, one later remembers 'I previously saw this blue' due to the connection between object and subject. The memory of consciousness arises not from consciousness having experienced itself, but from its connection with experiencing the object. This is compared to rat poison: during winter, when bitten by a poisonous rat, one experiences only the bite but not the poison entering the body. Later, when the poison is activated by spring thunder, one newly develops the awareness thinking, 'Poison must have entered along with the wound before,' despite not having directly experienced the poison at the time it entered.\n\nSimilarly, blue-perception experiencing its object is like being bitten by a rat. The subject existing simultaneously with the grasping of the object is analogous to poison entering with the bite. Later remembering the object enables one to remember the earlier subject, even though the subject did not experience itself, just as remembering the bite enables one to infer the previously unperceived poison. This brilliantly explains how memory can arise without self-awareness, refuting the Cittamātra position that memory necessarily proves self-awareness.",
    "<9><25> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhen one is endowed with other conditions such as meditative concentration (śamatha) and purification of mental states, one can perceive even the minds of other persons at a distance. The Cittamātrins argue that therefore one's own consciousness, which is extremely proximate, must necessarily be clear to oneself as its own object. They use an analogy: just as when one sees a distant hair or needle, one will certainly see a nearby rope or mountain.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is not conclusive. Consider this example: through the application of magical eye medicine (siddha-añjana) that has been empowered through secret mantras, one can see treasures like jars buried underground at great distances, even though they are obscured and obstructed. Yet one cannot see the eye medicine itself, though it is extremely close to oneself. \n\nMoreover, this example actually serves as an objection to self-awareness (svasaṃvedana). Even though the illuminated object (the jar) and the illuminator (the eye ointment) arise from the same cause of illumination, they are not established as identical nor as having the same nature. This not only fails to establish self-awareness but becomes a refutation of its existence.\n\nThe Cittamātrins further claim that if consciousness itself were not luminous and cognizant, it could not illuminate itself, and thus could not illuminate other things either. In that case, all conventional designations of seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, and knowing with the mind would be impossible, because all these must be established in dependence on luminous, cognizant consciousness.",
    "<9><26> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'What is seen, heard, and cognized is not to be refuted here.' This verse clarifies that ordinary perceptions - what we see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and understand with our minds - are not themselves the objects of negation in Madhyamaka philosophy. There is no need to negate conventional appearances because mere appearances alone don't produce suffering, and even Arhats still experience conventional designations.\n\n'Rather, what is to be eliminated here is the conception of truth regarding these things, which is the cause of suffering.' The actual object of negation is our mistaken conceptualization that grasps at these conventional phenomena as truly or inherently existent. This grasping at true existence is identified as the root cause of suffering and the foundation of cyclic existence (saṃsāra).\n\nThe commentary explains that 'seeing' refers to direct perception through sense consciousness, 'hearing' refers to learning from others, and 'cognizing' refers to what is established through valid inference. These conventional designations cannot be refuted because attempting to do so would create logical contradictions - one would need to use scripture and reasoning to negate them, but the same problem would apply to the scripture and reasoning themselves. Such a position would lead to nihilism.\n\nAs stated in the 'Entry into Reality' (Tattvāvatāra): 'Due to grasping at true existence, defects such as attachment and aversion arise as enemies from within. If this grasping is reversed, how could those defects possibly arise?' By teaching that grasping at form, sound, and other phenomena as truly existent is the root of saṃsāra, this verse implies that Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas do realize the selflessness of phenomena, contrary to some interpretations.",
    "<9><27> Combined Commentary\n\nThe Mind-Only proponents claim that since external objects do not truly exist, illusory appearances like forms are not substantially different from mind. However, they also refrain from asserting that these appearances are identical with the mind, due to the fault mentioned earlier, 'At that time, who sees what?' This creates a dilemma in their position.\n\nIf the appearance of external objects is not different from one's own mind (meaning not established as an external reality), one might think these appearances are identical with the mind. However, they cannot be considered one with the mind either, because if they were truly one, the mind's nature as a singular, indivisible entity would be compromised.\n\nThe objective aspect, which resembles an illusion, is therefore considered to be neither something external different from mind, nor conceptualized as non-different or being the mind itself. Rather, Mind-Only proponents attempt to posit it as inexpressible as either identical to or different from mind.\n\nBut this position invites objection: if forms and other appearances were truly established entities, they would have to be true as they appear. Since they appear as external objects, they would have to be established as such, and if they were external entities, how could they not be substantially different from the mind? It would logically follow they are different.\n\nConversely, if you say these appearances are not substantially different from mind, it would follow that they do not exist as true entities, because they would be non-different from what you've already accepted as false appearances. There seems to be no way to maintain their true existence while also claiming they are neither identical to nor different from mind.\n\nThis contradiction reveals that if you assert that the mind is a real entity, how can the object or appearance not be different from it? Since you consider the appearance to be non-existent, a contradiction between existence and non-existence in the same basis is impossible. The Mind-Only position faces serious logical problems regardless of how it attempts to categorize these illusory appearances.",

This part begins an affirmation after the previous section's refutation.\n\n**བལྟ་བྱ་དེ་བཞིན་ལྟ་བྱེད་ཡིད། །**\nSimilarly, the perceiving mind or consciousness, though itself not truly established and unreal like an illusion, can conventionally function as a perceiver.

This verse raises a fundamental philosophical question: If saṃsāra and other phenomena are considered non-entities (དངོས་མེད་) that depend on truly established entities (དངོས་), how could they perform functions like binding and liberating beings? Just as a rabbit's horn, even when resting on a hand, cannot dig the earth, similarly, something utterly non-existent cannot depend on anything to produce effects. If saṃsāra were dependent on a truly established basis, it would be either one with the mind or different from it—either position leads to contradictions in the Cittamātra view.\n\n'Your mind would become a solitary entity without a companion.' This points to a consequence for the Cittamātra system: if you maintain that consciousness is a truly established entity while rejecting external objects and the duality of subject and object as false, then consciousness would become a self-cognizing, self-illuminating awareness existing in isolation. Since you've already refuted the appearance of form as being consciousness itself, and you don't accept external objects, your mind would exist without the companionship of perceived objects.

The question points to the gap between intellectual understanding and complete transformation.\n\n**གང་ཚེ་སྒྱུ་མའི་བུད་མེད་ལ། །** (When, regarding an illusory woman...)\n\nConsider that even a magician who clearly knows the woman he has conjured is merely an illusion with no real existence - she is empty of being an actual woman - may still serve as a powerful example of how intellectual understanding doesn't automatically eliminate affliction.\n\n**དེ་བྱེད་ཉིད་ཀྱང་ཆགས་སྐྱེ་འགྱུར། །** (Even the creator himself generates attachment.)\n\nEven the creator of the illusion himself might generate desire for the illusory woman when he thinks, 'If only this illusory woman were suitable for enjoyment.' This demonstrates that merely knowing something is illusory doesn't automatically eliminate our emotional reactions to it. This points to the limitation of intellectual understanding of emptiness gained through initial hearing and contemplation, as opposed to deep meditative realization that can truly transform the mind.\n\n[This critique sets up the subsequent sections that will explain why desire arises in the magician despite his knowledge, how afflictive emotions can actually be eliminated through thoroughly cultivating the wisdom that realizes emptiness, and how complete results arise from such elimination.]",
    "<9><32> Combined Commentary: Sentence-by-Sentence Explanation\n\n**'The creator of the illusion [this refers to] has not abandoned the latent tendencies of mental afflictions in relation to objects of knowledge.'**\n\nThe magician who creates the magical illusion (such as an illusory woman) still retains the latent tendencies of afflictions—primarily the grasping at true existence—toward objects of knowledge. Though he knows his creation is illusory, he has not abandoned his subtle belief in true existence, nor has he eliminated the habitual tendencies of afflictions such as attachment toward actual objects like real women.\n\n**'Therefore, when he sees that [illusion], the latent tendency toward emptiness is weak indeed.'**\n\nConsequently, when the magician observes his magical creation and recognizes its emptiness (that it lacks the nature of being a real woman), his latent tendency toward emptiness remains weak and ineffective. This understanding of the illusion's emptiness lacks sufficient power to counteract the deeply ingrained grasping at true existence, because this partial recognition of emptiness doesn't directly contradict the fundamental mode of apprehension that clings to inherent existence.\n\n**'For instance, the creator of a magical woman—that is, the agent—has not abandoned the latent tendencies of afflictions such as attachment toward any object of knowledge, such as women and so forth.'**\n\nThe magician who conjures a magical woman has not eliminated the deeply rooted tendencies toward attachment and other afflictions regarding actual objects of knowledge like real women. His understanding that his creation is merely illusory doesn't transfer to his perception of real phenomena, which he still grasps at as inherently existent. The magician's situation illustrates how merely recognizing the emptiness of one phenomenon in a limited way doesn't necessarily lead to understanding the pervasive emptiness of all phenomena.\n\n**'In his mind, there is no emptiness that directly contradicts the grasping at true existence, and just as seeing that an actual external woman is empty would not give rise to desires such as pursuing and associating with a magical woman.'**\n\nThe magician's weak understanding of emptiness doesn't directly contradict his fundamental grasping at true existence. This is because the grasping at true existence has been deeply habituated since beginningless time, thoroughly permeating the mind like a dye. Unlike simple conceptual errors that can be immediately corrected (such as mistaking a rope for a snake), the deep-seated grasping at inherent existence requires extensive cultivation of the emptiness realization through meditation before it can be uprooted completely with all its seeds. This is why the path requires long periods of meditative cultivation rather than instant elimination of afflictions upon first realizing emptiness.",
    "<9><33> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nBy habituating oneself to the imprints of emptiness—the realization that all phenomena lack inherent nature—one dispels the imprints of grasping at entities as truly existent, which has been our contradictory perspective since beginningless time. Through habituation to understanding that 'nothing whatsoever exists' (meaning that even the absence of true existence itself lacks true existence), one will later abandon even the grasping at emptiness or non-existence as truly existent. \n\nWhen one initially negates phenomena as empty, the conception of non-existence is merely a conceptual elimination of something else and is not genuinely established as the authentic nature of phenomena. Although one may realize that illusion is empty, if one has not realized that all phenomena are empty, the latent tendencies of attachment will still be activated. \n\nIf one objects: 'While entities can be negated as non-existent, how can this non-existence itself be negated? If it were negated, it would revert to existence,' the response is that initially, one must establish and habituate oneself to non-existence in opposition to the attachment to existence. However, when one negates the subtle object of negation—which considers existence to be that which is truly established rather than merely posited by terms and conventions—the grasping at the negation as truly existent is eliminated at that very moment.\n\nThis accords with Nāgārjuna's words in the Lokātītastava: 'You taught the nectar of emptiness to dispel all conceptual constructions. You also rejected those who became attached to that emptiness.' Since it is impossible for afflictions to arise when one does not grasp at anything whatsoever, the abandonment of both grasping at entities and grasping at emptiness leads to complete liberation.",
    "<9><34> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen the verse says 'When something that is to be examined is not observed, saying 'it does not exist,'' it refers to when, upon analysis and investigation, any entity (such as form) which is the object of examination cannot be found as inherently arising in conventional terms. At that time, when we conclude 'it does not exist,' we must consider what this non-existence means.\n\nThe verse then asks: 'How can that non-existence, which lacks a basis, remain before the mind?' This points to a crucial understanding - that non-existence itself cannot stand independently before consciousness as an object of focus. Since there can be no quality (dharma) separate from its basis (dharmin), if the object itself is not established, then its non-existence cannot be truly established either.\n\nThis is similar to the example found in both commentaries: if a barren woman's son is never born, his death cannot be observed either. Just as the death of a non-existent son cannot exist because the son himself does not exist, the non-existence of any phenomenon cannot exist independently of the phenomenon itself.\n\nTherefore, non-existence is merely established in dependence upon existence and does not exist as something independently established by its own nature. If emptiness of true existence were truly established, it would have to be established as the intrinsic nature of a basis - but the establishment of that basis as having a truly existing nature has already been refuted.",
    "<9><35> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen neither an entity nor a non-entity dwells before the mind, at that time, due to the absence of any other mode of true establishment (such as both, neither, and so forth), all conceptual reference points such as 'empty' or 'not empty' cease entirely, and all elaborations are completely pacified. This refers to the state where there is no focal object for grasping at true existence, and the mind reaches thorough pacification.\n\nWhen entities and non-entities do not remain before the mind, there is no third category beyond the dual possibilities. Through cultivating this realization to its ultimate point, the mind that grasps objects ceases and attains complete pacification. This is the equality that is like the center of space, distinguished solely by self-aware primordial wisdom, beyond expression, thought, or words.\n\nAs stated in the Madhyamakāvatāra: 'When the dry timber of knowable objects is entirely consumed by fire, that pacification is the Dharmakāya of the Victorious Ones.' However, this does not mean Buddhas lack wisdom. The Great Commentary explains: 'It is pacified because all conceptual elaborations are completely stilled; it is not extinction like a fire that has gone out.' What ceases is the mind that grasps at objects within the four logical possibilities—the conceptual thinking that clings to them—rather than wisdom itself.\n\nFor one who directly realizes emptiness, even dualistic appearances related to emptiness are pacified. For one who understands emptiness merely through conceptual universals, though dualistic appearances are not eliminated, the conceptual elaborations of definitive true existence are refuted.\n\nSome mistakenly claim that 'when the true nature of reality is directly perceived, there is neither a consciousness nor an object of knowledge,' while asserting emptiness of true existence to be truly established. This clearly shows a failure to understand even slightly the intention of the great chariot-makers [founders of the tradition].\n\nIf all conceptual thoughts are completely pacified in a Buddha, one might object that the Buddha would not work for the welfare of others since there would be no thought 'I will teach the Dharma to disciples.' This raises the question: how could they perform activities for sentient beings such as teaching the Dharma? This objection will be addressed in the following section.",

The Buddhas appear in physical form and teach the Dharma through the dual influence of the disciples' purified mental continuum (or accumulated merit such as meeting with a Buddha) and the power of the Buddhas' previous aspirations to effortlessly and spontaneously benefit sentient beings. Thus, the Buddha appears in whatever form is necessary to tame each being, and constantly performs beneficial activities through teaching the Dharma and other means.\n\nIf one objects that it is unreasonable for aspirations made long ago to produce results now, or that it is unreasonable for the aspirations made by Bodhisattvas to result in the activities of the Buddhas (since the bodhisattva's aspirational prayers cease when one attains Buddhahood), there is no fault in this explanation. When one attains the ultimate nirvana where all exertion on the path of training has completely ceased and one never moves from the dharmadhātu, although there is no conceptual effort, enlightened activity still functions for the benefit of others—as illustrated by the examples of the gem and wish-granting tree.

It is unnecessary and unreasonable.'\n\nThe commentary explains that this is the objection of those who fear the Mahāyāna teaching that all phenomena are empty, and who reject it, claiming that one can realize selflessness of the person without understanding emptiness. Some Śrāvaka schools not only claim that realizing emptiness is unnecessary for attaining Buddhahood, but they don't even accept the term 'selflessness of phenomena' and don't recognize Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic Buddha-word.\n\nThe response to this objection is threefold. First, it explains that without emptiness, it is impossible to have an antidote that can eradicate afflictions from their root. Second, it cites scriptures such as the Prajñāpāramitā, which state that 'without this path of realizing emptiness, the three forms of awakening are impossible.' It teaches that there is no liberation or awakening for those who maintain the perception of inherently existing entities. Third, it establishes that even the fruits of Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas cannot be attained without relying on the perfection of wisdom, emptiness.\n\nAs further scriptural evidence, the commentary cites: 'For those who have a concept of real entities, there is no cultivation of the perfection of wisdom,' and 'Those who wish to become Hearers of the Sugata, or Solitary Realizers, or likewise Dharma Kings, without relying on this patience [for the profound dharma], they will not attain it.'\n\nThe master composed this text intending to refute the misconception that Mahāyāna sūtras are not the Buddha's word, establishing that wisdom realizing emptiness is the path to all three types of enlightenment.",
    "<9><42> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf the Mahāyāna is not established as the Buddha's word, then how is the scripture of you, the Śrāvaka, established as the Buddha's word? This verse addresses those Śrāvakas, particularly those with conceited pride who are overly attached to their own doctrinal positions and argue that 'The Mahāyāna is not Buddha's word.'\n\nWhen the text asks 'how is your scripture established,' it challenges the Śrāvakas to explain how their own texts (the Four Āgamas, the four divisions of the Vinaya, the sutras derived from them, the seven collections of Abhidharma, and so on) can be considered authentic while rejecting Mahāyāna texts.\n\nTo this challenge, a Śrāvaka might respond: 'Our scriptures are established as authoritative for both of us, aren't they? Therefore, there is no dispute about these being the Buddha's word.' This is what the verse refers to when it says 'established for both.'\n\nHowever, the text then questions what 'both' really means here. Does it mean you and I, or any two others? If it refers to both the Mahāyāna proponent and the Śrāvaka opponent, then the argument fails because when the Śrāvaka was first born and in similar early states, these Hīnayāna collections were not yet established for them as the Buddha's word. There was a time before they came to accept these texts through reasoning and proper study.\n\nThe argument shows that the Śrāvaka's acceptance of their own texts follows the same pattern they should apply to Mahāyāna texts—both require investigation and reasoning to establish validity. Since there is no inherent connection between scripture and person, the claim that 'it is established for both' cannot stand as a definitive argument. The same methods of establishing confidence in scripture (such as practices permitted in the Vinaya, engagement with the Sūtras, and non-contradiction with the nature of reality) apply equally to both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna texts.",
    "<9><43> Combined Commentary\n\n'Whatever reason causes you to have faith in your scripture...' This verse examines the reasons for accepting Buddhist texts as reliable. When you were first born, even the lower baskets of teachings were not established for you as valid. The causes for developing reliable confidence in scripture include: it was first spoken by the Buddha, then compiled by Arhats, clarified by commentaries, transmitted through a lineage of reliable gurus, and established through reasoning as teachings showing the correct path without contradicting the three modes of analysis of the Dharma.\n\n'...that same reason applies equally to the Mahāyāna as well.' If these are your reasons for accepting the Hinayana scriptures as authentic, then these same causes for reliable confidence exist equally for the Mahāyāna. The Mahāyāna was also first spoken by the Buddha, compiled by Mañjuśrī, Maitreya and others, clarified by commentaries by Maitreya, Nāgārjuna and others, transmitted through a lineage of reliable gurus, and does not contradict the three modes of analysis of the Dharma.\n\n'If others' two desires make truth...' This addresses a potential objection based on consensus. If something were considered true merely because two individuals desired or accepted it to be true, then this creates a problematic standard.\n\n'...then even the Vedas and such would become true.' By this faulty logic, even non-Buddhist texts like the Vedas would become authentic and true, since there exist at least two individuals who consider them valid scriptures. Therefore, mere acceptance by some arbitrary number of people cannot be the criterion for scriptural authenticity.",
    "<9><44> Combined Commentary\n\nIf someone objects, 'Mahāyāna is not a reliable scripture because it is subject to dispute,' then this objection fails because merely being subject to disputes does not make a scripture invalid. If that were the case, then even your own general Buddhist scriptures would need to be abandoned since they are disputed by non-Buddhists. Furthermore, even among fellow Buddhists themselves, there are internal disputes—between different philosophical schools and the eighteen Hīnayāna sects—regarding specific scriptural traditions or approaches.\n\nSome might argue: 'The Hīnayāna scriptures that we accept are uncontested because Mahāyānists also accept them as Buddha's Word, whereas the Mahāyāna scriptures are contested because we do not accept them.' But this reasoning fails because non-Buddhist outsiders dispute the Hīnayāna scriptures with the Śrāvaka schools. Additionally, even though all eighteen Śrāvaka schools accept the Hīnayāna scriptures as valid in general, certain specific texts—such as those teaching the existence of an intermediate state—are accepted as Buddha's Word by some Śrāvaka schools but rejected by others, creating internal disputes between one's own and others' positions.\n\nIf something were considered authentically true merely because two arbitrary persons accept it as valid, then even the Vedic texts would have to be considered true, since there are people who accept them as valid. Therefore, by your own reasoning, the Lesser Vehicle should also be rejected as Buddha's words if mere dispute is sufficient grounds for rejection.",
    "<9><45> Combined Commentary\n\nThe verse explains that although the root of a genuine teaching's endurance is genuine monkhood (bhikṣuhood), even monkhood itself is difficult to maintain. This refers specifically to the bhikṣu who is an Arhat, as heard directly from the Buddha and compiled by the Arhats themselves.\n\nAmong the five categories of monks (those in name only, by self-proclamation, those who beg, fully ordained monks, and those who have abandoned afflictions), the last two are supreme and constitute the root of the teaching. The Arhat bhikṣu represents the ultimate monk, yet this state is extremely difficult to maintain.\n\nThe verse then states that for those whose minds retain objective references (possess objects of grasping), even nirvāṇa is difficult to maintain or attain. This is because without understanding emptiness—that phenomena are empty of inherent existence—it is impossible to uproot afflictions completely.\n\nThe main antidote that eliminates afflictions is the wisdom realizing selflessness. Without this understanding of emptiness, even if one temporarily suppresses afflictions through practices like meditative concentration, they will eventually resurface. Those who grasp at true existence cannot attain nirvāṇa because they cannot eliminate the root cause of suffering.\n\nBoth personal selflessness and the selflessness of phenomena are forms of emptiness, differing only in their subjects, not in their mode of emptiness. The wisdom realizing both types of selflessness is necessary to eliminate all obscurations. Without the realization of emptiness, not only is Buddhahood unattainable, but even the state of Arhatship remains beyond reach.\n\nTherefore, the verse implies that as long as grasping at true existence remains, nirvāṇa cannot be attained, making both bhikṣuhood and liberation difficult to accomplish for those who do not accept and realize the emptiness of phenomena.",

Although it is granted that Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas who are Arhats have eliminated afflictive craving through cultivating the path of impermanence and so forth, this does not mean they become completely extinguished like a lamp whose continuum has been severed.\n\nEven though this craving in the mental continuum of an Arhat may not be afflictive in the sense described in the Abhidharma, why would there not still be a non-afflictive form of craving? Just as the Abhidharma maintains that ignorance (avidyā) can be either afflicted or unafflicted, we should likewise accept that craving can exist in both an afflicted and unafflicted form.\n\nWhile the Arhat may have temporarily abandoned manifest craving induced by self-grasping at a person as a substantially existent independent entity, they have not eliminated the craving induced by the view of the transitory collection that grasps at the person as inherently existent. Although they may have eliminated afflictive craving, they still possess the complete collection of causes for the formation of a mental body, and there are no obstacles to this.\n\nTherefore, even if one is not liberated from suffering immediately after abandoning the afflictions as understood in the lower vehicles, the presence of this non-afflictive craving explains why Arhats continue to take rebirth despite having abandoned afflictive craving. Indeed, this non-afflictive craving does exist, just as non-afflictive ignorance exists.",
    "<9><48> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n'Craving arises due to the condition of sensation.'\n\nThis verse establishes a critical causal relationship: since Arhats have not reversed the fundamental cause of ignorance—the grasping at phenomena as truly existent—they still experience sensations. Though they have eliminated afflictive ignorance, they retain non-afflictive ignorance regarding knowable objects. When sentient beings have not realized emptiness, they inevitably develop craving as a response to feelings—desiring pleasant sensations and avoiding unpleasant ones—because they grasp at feelings as inherently existent.\n\n'These sensations also exist in those [Arhats].'\n\nEven in Arhats who have achieved individual liberation, sensations continue to exist because they have not eliminated the subtle predispositions of ignorance. This is established through the logical reasoning of complete causal assembly. Since they have not abandoned the ground of ignorant predispositions, they continue to experience sensations, though without the afflictive responses that ordinary beings have. These sensations persist because they have not fully realized the selflessness of phenomena.\n\n'Minds endowed with objects'\n\nThe minds of these Arhats still operate with reference points, observing phenomena as if they had true existence. They continue to make distinctions between cyclic existence and nirvana, things to be abandoned and their remedies. Unlike those who have realized emptiness completely, their cognition remains subtly dualistic, grasping at conceptual elaborations.\n\n'Will remain dwelling in certain [aspects].'\n\nAs long as the mind that observes true existence in phenomena remains manifest in some individuals' mental continua, they cannot achieve the complete pacification that comes from being without reference points. Although these Arhats will not take rebirth in cyclic existence due to their elimination of afflictions, they have not achieved the ultimate cessation because they maintain subtle conceptual frameworks. Their liberation is therefore not permanent, and they must eventually enter the Greater Vehicle to realize the emptiness of all phenomena as lacking inherent nature.",
    "<9><49> Combined Commentary on the Verse\n\n'A mind devoid of emptiness' refers to a consciousness that lacks realization of emptiness—the profound understanding that all phenomena (both persons and aggregates) are empty of inherent existence by their own characteristics. Such a mind remains accompanied by conceptual elaborations such as existence and non-existence, and continues to grasp at true existence.\n\n'Will cease and be born again' indicates that although such a mind may temporarily cease manifest afflictions during meditative absorption, these afflictions will inevitably arise again in manifest form after the cessation. This occurs because the mind still possesses the causes that project a mental body—namely, uncontaminated karma and the ground of habitual ignorance in the mindstream—and because it has not obtained the antidote of emptiness in which all conceptual elaborations have ceased.\n\n'Like the meditative absorption of non-perception' provides an apt comparison. Just as in the meditative absorption of non-perception (or among gods of non-perception), where consciousness temporarily ceases but later arises again because the seeds of affliction remain, similarly a mind that has not realized emptiness will experience temporary cessation of afflictions but inevitably return to them.\n\n'Therefore, emptiness should be cultivated' concludes that it is absolutely necessary to cultivate emptiness—the negation of subtle objects of negation—not only for those wishing to attain omniscience but even for those merely seeking arhatship. Without realizing emptiness, neither temporary nor ultimate nirvana can be attained, for as long as the mind abides on and becomes attached to objects, suffering will continue to arise.\n\nAs the Sacred White Lotus Sutra states: 'What is called nirvana here—although you have been freed from the sufferings of samsara, you have still not truly gone beyond sorrow. Seek this supreme vehicle of the Buddha.' Those who wish to exhaust all suffering must therefore meditate on emptiness.",

The opponent claims that 'Any speech within the scriptural teachings that properly engages with these three collections should be accepted as the Buddha's spoken word, but Mahāyāna is not Buddha's word because it supposedly obstructs the three trainings by teaching that all phenomena are empty.' In response, the verse challenges: Isn't it the case that most Mahāyāna sūtras are indeed accepted as being similar to your sūtras and so forth? They too teach the three trainings. If the opponent objects that 'We see teachings inconsistent with the lower baskets in Mahāyāna texts,' the verse is preemptively questioning the consistency of their position—if adherence to the three trainings is the criterion, then Mahāyāna texts satisfy this criterion.",

If you accept that all Mahāyāna sūtras are flawed by using as justification a single sūtra which you have not fully recognized as possessing the characteristics you have established for buddha-word, then why would you not accept that all Mahāyāna sūtras were spoken by the Victorious One when you see a single Mahāyāna sūtra that possesses the characteristics that you accept as buddha-word?\n\nIf one explains that this refers to not contradicting the three trainings as subject matter, then this exists in the Mahāyāna as well, in a manner that enhances what is found in the Hīnayāna. As stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra: 'Because it engages with one's own nature, because it appears in one's own discipline, because of its profundity and vastness, it does not contradict reality.'\n\nIf you object that 'If the extensive Prajñāpāramitā and others are buddha-word, then Mahākāśyapa and others should have comprehended their meaning,' but since they did not comprehend it, these cannot be Buddha's word, this reasoning is flawed.

Although ultimate suffering is not truly possible from the perspective of emptiness, for the benefit of others who suffer due to not understanding this, the bodhisattva generates great compassion.\n\n 'ཆགས་དང་འཇིགས་མཐའ་ལས་གྲོལ་བ། །' (Freed from the extremes of attachment and fear)\n\nThrough realizing emptiness, one becomes free from two extremes: the extreme of attachment to existence (held by ordinary beings who grasp at phenomena as truly existent and cycle in samsara under the influence of karma and afflictions), and the extreme of fear or terror of existence (exemplified by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who, frightened by samsara's suffering, seek nirvana merely by escaping rebirth).\n\n 'འཁོར་བར་གནས་པ་འགྲུབ་འགྱུར་བ། །' (Establishing dwelling in samsara)\n\nThus, the noble bodhisattvas can establish themselves in samsara through the power of compassion while remaining untainted by its faults—like a lotus growing in mud.

The verse systematically refutes this notion.\n\n'Teeth and hair and nails are not the self' - If we examine whether this so-called 'self' is identical with the thirty-two teeth, we find this untenable. If the self were identical with teeth, the self would become material, impermanent, and thirty-two in number. When teeth fall out, the self would cease to exist. Similarly, the twenty-one thousand hairs and twenty nails cannot be the self, as they are merely designated as 'mine' but are not 'me.'\n\n'The self is not bones or blood' - The self is not the three hundred and sixty bone fragments of one's body, nor is it the blood. If the self were identical with bones, it would be multiple and divisible. If different, statements like 'my bones hurt' would be illogical. The same applies to blood.\n\n'It is not mucus or phlegm' - The self is not nasal mucus, nor is it phlegm—the moist elements that exist in the form of stomach fluids and mucus. These are merely imputed designations that we attribute to the self but cannot themselves be the basis of selfhood.\n\n'Nor is it lymph or pus' - The self is not the lymph fluid nor pus, which is in the form of putrefied blood. These constituents are impermanent, multiple, and lack self-sovereignty—characteristics that contradict the notion of a permanent, singular, independent self that various philosophical systems assert.\n\nThis systematic refutation corresponds to those in the Precious Garland of the Middle Way where the six elements are rejected as constituting the person. It establishes that even conventionally, neither the collection of aggregates, nor their continuity, nor their individual parts can be taken as the basis of the person. The self is merely designated in dependence upon these aggregates without existing by its own characteristics.\n\nThis verse begins a broader refutation that targets both Buddhist proponents of real entities (who maintain that the aggregates are the basis of the person) and non-Buddhist schools like the Sāṃkhya and Vaiśeṣika (who assert a self existing separate from the aggregates). By understanding this refutation, one can avoid falling into the extremes of eternalism or nihilism regarding the self.",

Moreover, when teeth fall out, the self would cease to exist, which is untenable.\n\n'I am not bones or blood' - Similarly, the three hundred and sixty bone fragments that exist in one's body, nor the blood, can be the basis of the self. These components are merely labeled as self but are not inherently the self.\n\n'I am not mucus or phlegm' - The wet elements present in the form of stomach mucus and so forth are not the self.

This analysis corresponds to the refutation in Nāgārjuna's Ratnāvalī, which disproves that the six elements constitute the person. Therefore, even conventionally, neither the collection of aggregates, nor their continuum, nor their components, nor their parts can be established as the basis of the person.

    "<9><60> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'Flesh and skin are not the self.' This verse explains that the physical components of the body cannot be identified as the self because they consist of multiple parts, arise from numerous atomic particles, and are impermanent. These characteristics contradict the defining features of what a self is supposed to be—singular, independent, and permanent.\n\n'Heat and wind are also not the self.' Bodily warmth (the fire element) and the vital energies or winds within the body, including inhalation and exhalation, cannot be the self for the same reasons as above. The Ratnāvalī similarly refutes these elements as being the person or self.\n\n'Openings are not the self in any way.' The various orifices or apertures of the body (representing the space element) are merely empty spaces and cannot constitute a self. This corresponds to the refutation of the space element as the person.\n\n'The six consciousnesses are also not the self.' The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mental consciousnesses cannot be the self because they are multiple, momentary, and impermanent. This specifically refutes the Sāṃkhya position that the self is consciousness. The Sāṃkhyas assert twenty-five knowable objects, with the self being the twenty-fifth—a permanent, conscious entity that experiences but doesn't create transformations.\n\nAccording to the Sutra of the Meeting of Father and Son, these six elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness) together are merely labeled as 'person,' but there is no inherently existing 'I.' This understanding corresponds to the Buddhist position that the self is merely imputed in dependence on the aggregates, rather than being substantially established either as identical to or separate from them.\n\nThe analogy of mistaking a rope for a snake in dim lighting illustrates how we mistakenly perceive a self in the aggregates due to ignorance. Just as bringing a lamp into a dark room would reveal there is no snake but merely a rope, direct perception of selflessness reveals that 'The self to which I cling in these five aggregates is merely a designation and doesn't actually exist.'\n\nTherefore, neither the collection of aggregates, nor their continuum, nor their individual components can be established as the basis of the person. The person exists merely as a conventional designation, operating without analysis, like the names 'Devadatta' or 'Yajñadatta.' If one asserts an intrinsically established basis for the term 'person,' one falls into either eternalism or nihilism.",

If you argue that 'The reason it does not apprehend sound at all times is not because consciousness is impermanent, but because the object, sound, is not presently available,' this position becomes untenable. When the object of knowledge such as sound does not exist, what could that consciousness possibly cognize or know? On what basis or for what reason would one designate it as 'consciousness of' or 'knowledge of' a particular object? Since consciousness is defined by its relation to its object, without an object, it would be improper and unreasonable to designate something as the consciousness or knowledge of that object. This demonstrates that consciousness must be impermanent, changing in accordance with the presence or absence of its objects.",
    "<9><62> Combined Commentary for the Source Text\n\nIf it were the case that a consciousness could be established as a cognition even without actually cognizing an object, then absurdly, even wood would become a cognizer (or consciousness) of objects like sound. This is because you would be accepting the existence of consciousness without requiring it to actually engage with an object of knowledge, which is illogical. Therefore, it is definitively established that without the presence or proximity of an object of knowledge (such as sound), there cannot be a consciousness that apprehends it. Consciousness necessarily depends on whatever object it cognizes; it is impossible to have consciousness without cognizing an object.\n\nAn opponent might object: 'When sound is absent, sound-cognition need not be absent, because the same consciousness that previously cognized sound can later, when sound is absent, cognize forms and so forth, making these two (sound-cognition and form-cognition) identical.' This objection will be refuted through multiple approaches, including maintaining the previous consequence, demonstrating the contradiction between cognitive aspects, and negation through the reasoning of mutual non-observation. Without an object to establish consciousness, one would be forced into the absurd position that there is no time when a person does not apprehend sound.",

The opponent claims that the same consciousness which previously knew sound later knows form, indicating permanence with merely different apprehended objects. The argument counters: If this consciousness or self is truly permanent and unchanging, then at the precise moment it apprehends form, it should simultaneously hear sound as well, since it would retain its previous nature as a sound-cognizer. A permanent entity that previously cognized sound should not lose that capacity simply by cognizing form.\n\n**Line 3-4**: 'If [you argue that] it is because sound is not proximate, then the consciousness of that [sound] would also not exist.'\n\nHere, the verse anticipates an opponent's objection that the permanent consciousness doesn't hear sound while perceiving form because sound isn't present or proximate at that moment. The response is decisive: if the object (sound) is absent, then the consciousness that takes sound as its object should also be absent according to the same reasoning. This directly contradicts the opponent's assertion of a permanent consciousness or a permanent all-pervading self (person). This demonstrates the logical inconsistency in claiming that consciousness is permanent while acknowledging that it varies with its objects.",
    "<9><64> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nFurthermore, how can that which has the nature of grasping sound grasp visual form as its object? It follows that it cannot, because these two aspects have distinct natures and are completely contradictory to each other. This refutes the permanence and singular reality of consciousness.\n\nSomeone might argue: 'Just as one person can be both a father and a son, there is no contradiction in objects like sound and form. From the perspective of manifestation, what is form is also sound from the perspective of intrinsic nature, since both share the same intrinsic nature. Therefore, when apprehending form, even though there is no manifestation as sound, consciousness is still grasping sound's intrinsic nature.'\n\nThis example is invalid because a single person is merely designated or imputed as father and son in relation to different referents, rather than being established as such in ultimate reality. If one were truly established as a father by its own nature, it would be impossible for that person to be a son, since a father must necessarily exist before his son. Similarly, if one were truly established as a son by its own nature, it would be impossible to be a father.\n\nTherefore, father and son are merely conceptualized as relating to a single entity, but not truly established as such in an ultimate sense. We do not deny what is merely imputed, but this conventional designation does not accomplish the opponent's intended position, which requires these relations to exist in an ultimately established way.",

This verse refutes the Sāṃkhya view of ultimate reality. If there were truly a father and son in ultimate reality, since Sāṃkhyas accept nothing apart from the three qualities, they would have to exist among these qualities. However, the natures of sattva, rajas, and tamas themselves are neither son nor father.\n\n'That which perceives sound is not seen as having the nature of visual perception.' This part addresses the impossibility of sensory faculties sharing natures. Visual perception does not possess the nature of auditory perception. If form-apprehension existed as the nature of sound-cognition, it should be observable since it would be perceptible, but form-apprehension is never seen as having the nature of sound-apprehension.\n\nThe deeper implication is that if all manifestations were simply transformations of the same primordial nature, then in ultimate reality, it would be impossible to establish what is a son and what is a father, as their nature would be identical. Similarly, if visual perception could transform into auditory perception, consciousness would absurdly become impermanent and non-substantial, constantly discarding one mode for another.\n\nThis refutes the Sāṃkhya assertion that 'the supreme nature of qualities does not enter the path of perception' while maintaining that this imperceptible nature is the ultimate reality behind all perceived phenomena.",
    "<9><66> Combined Commentary\n\nLike an actor or dancer who appears as different characters (such as a god in the morning and a spirit in the evening) by changing costumes and movements, if it is claimed that consciousness operates similarly—where the same consciousness that previously perceived sound now appears in the form of visual perception through a different mode—then this would create a logical problem. If that very auditory perception were seen in a different manner with a visual perception manifestation, then consciousness would absurdly not be permanent or substantial, because it abandons one mode and takes up another.\n\nIf one objects that there is no fault because visual perception, though having a different mode from auditory perception, is of the same nature as auditory perception, then this concept of 'oneness' or 'identity' is unprecedented or has never existed as a valid object of knowledge in this world. This is because they exist only as separate and distinct perceptions. As the Great Commentary explains: 'If that single entity, even when another is later produced, is still that same single entity, then such a oneness is unprecedented because it accepts mutually contradictory things as one.'\n\nThough 'identity' is normally established as that which is indivisible in the nature of a phenomenon, while 'difference' is established as that which can be divided separately, here there is a manifest contradiction in accepting as identical what is directly observed to be distinct. If things can be identical despite being observed separately, it would absurdly follow that everything would be one single entity. Therefore, even the dancer at each instance when obtaining different forms represents a different moment, distinct from each other, and is not ultimately one single entity.",

Why? Because they are equivalent in terms of mere existence as objects of knowledge, without any true distinction between them. According to the Naiyāyikas and other schools, the self is accepted as all-pervasive like space, permanent, and partless.

In other words, if all the specific manifestations and transformations are false, then their supposed common foundation or universal basis (like pradhāna or consciousness itself) would also be untenable.

This refutes the position of schools like the Naiyāyikas and Vaiśeṣikas who maintain that the self is non-conscious or material in nature. When the self is posited as the agent of actions and the basis of pleasure and suffering, that which lacks consciousness cannot serve this function.\n\n'སེམས་མེད་ཉིད་ཕྱིར་བུམ་སོགས་བཞིན། །' (Because it is unconscious, just like a pot and so forth)\nThis line provides the reason and an example - because anything that lacks consciousness, such as a pot, cloth, or vase, cannot function as a self that experiences pleasure and pain or knows objects. These inanimate objects demonstrate that consciousness is a necessary quality for selfhood.\n\n'འོན་ཏེ་སེམས་དང་ལྡན་པའི་ཕྱིར། །' (If one argues that it possesses consciousness)\nThis addresses a potential objection from opponents who might claim: 'Although the self itself is inherently non-conscious or material, it can know objects because it becomes associated with consciousness through a relationship or blessing.' Their argument suggests that the self could retain its non-conscious nature while still functioning as a knower through this association.\n\n'ཤེས་ན་མི་ཤེས་འཇིག་པར་ཐལ། །' (Then the non-knowing self would be destroyed)\nThis final line points out the absurd consequence of the opponent's position: if a self whose intrinsic nature is to be non-cognizant were to become cognizant due to its association with consciousness, then the original non-conscious self would be destroyed. This would contradict the opponent's own assertion that the self is permanent and unchanging, as it would transform from something that doesn't know to something that does know, implying impermanence.",
    "<9><70> Combined Commentary\n\nIf the self is said to be unchangeable and permanent, what can consciousness (or mental activity) actually do for this self in terms of perceiving objects? How could consciousness cause any function in that self that would lead to awareness of objects? It cannot produce such a change, because the unchangeable self cannot be transformed from its original nature into something else, just as space cannot be colored blue by adding dye to it. It would absurdly follow that there is no change, because you have accepted the self as unchanging.\n\nThus, if one asserts that such a thing—which, being inanimate matter, does not know objects, and being permanent, is devoid of activity that produces effects—is the self, then this unconscious insentient entity, devoid of all activity, would be nothing more than space itself being merely presumed to be a 'self.' Space itself would become the self, or would be the self. There is no purpose in accepting such a self, because it does not provide even the slightest benefit or harm.\n\nThe third section addresses objections regarding selflessness, divided into parts: (1) refuting the objection that karma and its results would be impossible without a self, and (2) refuting the objection that compassion would be impossible without a self.

The objection here is that if all phenomena are merely momentary, produced and perishing in an instant, and if there is no permanent self that serves as the foundation for bondage and liberation, then the connection between actions and their results would be untenable.\n\nSince an agent who performs actions would disintegrate in the second moment after performing them, and since the aggregates arise and cease continuously, the agent would have ceased to exist immediately after performing the action. Therefore, when the time comes for experiencing the result, the original agent would no longer be present.\n\nIn such a case, it would be impossible for the action to ripen for the agent themselves, as that agent would be non-existent at the time of results. And if the result does not ripen for the original agent, it would be unreasonable for one person's action to ripen for someone else; therefore, whose action would it become when experiencing the result?

    "<9><72> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'བྱ་བ་འབྲས་བཞི་གཞི་ཐ་དད་དང་། །' - The basis of action (karma) and the basis of its result (vipāka) are different, namely the aggregates. When a person performs an action at the time of the cause, and when they experience the result at the time of fruition, these bases are substantially different. The aggregates at the time of performing the action in this life are different from the aggregates at the time of experiencing the results in the next life.\n\n'དེར་བདག་བྱེད་པ་མེད་པར་ཡང་། །' - Furthermore, in those two states (performing actions and experiencing results), there is no permanent self that acts as the agent. Both positions acknowledge that at the time of experiencing the result, the agent who performed the original action is no longer present in the same form. The self that is separate from the aggregates, being either unconscious or permanent, lacks agency or the capacity to perform actions.\n\n'ཡུ་བུ་གཉིས་ཀ་ལ་གྲུབ་པས། །' - This point is established for both of us—whether you who maintain that the self is permanent and material, or we who maintain selflessness. Both philosophical positions accept that the bases of action and result are different, and that there is no permanent self acting as agent across both states.\n\n'འདིར་བརྩད་དོན་མེད་མ་ཡིན་ནམ། །' - Therefore, is it not pointless to argue specifically against me that karma and its results are untenable? Since both positions face the same apparent problem—that the person performing an action is not the same as the one experiencing its results—this objection applies equally to both views. If this were considered a fault, it would apply equally to your own position. It is impossible to observe someone accumulating causes while simultaneously experiencing their results.

It is impossible to observe that 'one endowed with the cause' is simultaneously 'endowed with the result,' just as a father and son cannot be born simultaneously. The time of performing the causal action and the time of experiencing the result must necessarily be different.\n\n'མཐོང་བ་འདི་ནི་སྲིད་མ་ཡིན། །' (Seeing this is not possible)\nSeeing the result while the cause has not yet ceased is not possible, since results must arise from causes that have already been established. It is impossible to observe that the very same momentary aggregate that possesses the causal action directly experiences its own result. By the time results arise, causes have certainly ceased, yet the unfailing power of dependent origination necessarily produces results.\n\n'རྒྱུད་གཅིག་ལ་ནི་བརྟེན་ནས་སུ། །' (Relying on a single continuum)\nThis refers to depending on a single continuum of aggregates—the five aggregates continuing in similar type without interruption. The term 'continuum' refers to the possessor of parts that can be appropriated as earlier, later, and intermediate moments—in short, the appropriator. Such results ripen in the continuum of the person where the collection of causes was complete, not elsewhere—just as seeds planted in soil will not grow on rock.\n\n'བྱེད་པོ་སྤྱོད་པོ་ཞེས་བྱར་བསྟན། །' (It is taught that there is an agent and an experiencer)\nBased on this single continuum, one is 'designated as the agent' of actions and 'the experiencer' of results. This aligns with the Tathāgata's teaching: 'O monks, the fruits of actions performed and accumulated do not ripen in external elements like earth, but rather ripen in the aggregates, elements, and sense bases that constitute one's being.' The designation of identity is established in accordance with conventional understanding, not because there is a permanent self. Thus, it is reasonable to say that this person both performed the action and experienced the result, but this does not imply the existence of a single, permanent self.",

Like a plantain tree that, when broken down into its parts, reveals no inherently established essence, the self cannot be found when subjected to analysis.\n\nThis reasoning refutes the notion of a continuum being the self, as stated in the Madhyamakāvatāra: 'Because, according to Maitreya and Nyerban, phenomena are different from one another, they do not belong to a single continuum. Those things which by their own characteristics are separate cannot reasonably belong to a single continuum.'\n\nThrough this logical examination, the self is refuted not only in relation to the mind but in relation to all five aggregates as well, demonstrating that the self is not truly established when analyzed through the reasoning proving selflessness.",

And if one asserts that the present mind is the self, this would mean the self ceases to exist in the very next moment when that consciousness perishes.

    "<9><78> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'The pride that is the cause of suffering' refers to the self-conceit that serves as the root cause of saṃsāric suffering. This pride increases due to delusion about the self—the ignorance that perceives a non-existent self as truly existing. \n\nSomeone might object: 'Just as you cannot reverse your mind from the self you impute, similarly, the mind as a subject can never be reversed from the inherently established self, since it is intrinsic to our nature from beginningless time.'\n\nHowever, this objection is unfounded. The grasping at inherent existence can indeed be abandoned because it engages with reality in an erroneous way. It is extremely weak compared to the meditation on selflessness, which is supreme because it accords with the actual nature of phenomena. Just as light dispels darkness, the valid cognition of selflessness has greater power to eliminate self-grasping.\n\nTherefore, until this self-grasping is abandoned, no matter what austerities, meditations, or spiritual practices one undertakes, one cannot transcend cyclic existence. The fortunate ones who desire liberation must ensure that all their practices serve as antidotes to this self-grasping.\n\nThe meditation on the selflessness of phenomena can be approached through the four applications of mindfulness: mindfulness of the body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. Regarding mindfulness of the body, we first establish that the body as a whole lacks inherent nature. If the body existed inherently, it would have to be found either as the individual limbs, as their collected aggregate, or as something separate from these—but it is not found as any of these.\n\nAs taught, 'When the body is seen as similar to space, that is the establishment of mindfulness with regard to observing the body.'

If there were a 'complete body' that could be grasped as a single, unitary entity, it would necessarily exist among these limbs, but it does not.\n\n**'The thighs and waist are not the body.'** - Similarly, the thighs and waist cannot be identified as the body itself, because the person's body is merely designated in dependence upon these parts. None of these individual components can be equated with what we call 'body.'\n\n**'The abdomen and back are not the body.'** - The abdomen and back are also not the body. When we search for the inherently existing 'body' in these parts, we cannot find it there either.\n\n**'The chest and shoulders are not the body.'** - Likewise, the chest and shoulders are not the body. Among all these limbs—the chest, shoulders, sides, hands, armpits, internal organs, head, and neck—which one is established as truly existent as 'the body'? None whatsoever.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the 'body' is merely imputed and does not exist inherently. Neither the individual parts, nor their collection, nor something separate in essence from these parts can be established as the inherently existing 'body.' Therefore, the body does not exist by its own nature but is merely designated conventionally in dependence upon its parts.",
    "<9><80> Combined Commentary Explanation (Sentence by Sentence)\n\nThe sides and hands are not the body—because they are merely parts upon which the designation 'body' is applied, not the body itself. The armpits and shoulders are not the body—they too are just individual components that don't conform to the defining characteristics of a complete body. The internal organs are also not that body—organs such as the lungs and heart are merely internal components, not the whole body. If the head and neck are also not the body—just as other parts are not, then what indeed is this thing called 'body' among all these components?\n\nWhen we examine this collection of parts—like hands, sides, armpits, shoulders, internal organs, head, and neck—none individually constitutes the body, as evident when a hand or other part is severed yet the 'body' is still considered to remain. Neither the collection of these parts nor something separate in nature from these parts is the person's body—just like scattered fragments in a charnel ground that may appear connected now but could exist independently. Someone might object: 'Although each component individually is not the body, the body exists pervading all these parts'—but when we examine where that whole body itself exists, no pervading body is found when each component is removed. Therefore, the body does not exist by its own nature—there is nothing whatsoever that can be identified as a truly existent body.",

This presents an absurd scenario.\n\nConsider two possibilities: First, if the body exists partially in different limbs (one portion in the hand, another in the leg, etc.), we face an infinite regression problem—because we would then need to ask where each part itself resides. The hand would reside in its own parts like fingers, those fingers in their smaller parts, and so on without end.\n\nAlternatively, if we claim the body exists as a complete whole in each limb without anything missing, then we would have multiple identical bodies equal to the number of limbs. For example, if the complete body exists in the hand, in the foot, in the arm, etc., then we would have numerous identical bodies rather than one unified body as we actually perceive.\n\nSince we perceive the body as a single whole entity, and not as multiple bodies, this understanding of the body's existence is logically untenable. This analysis demonstrates that the body cannot be established as inherently existing either as a whole entity residing in its parts or as separate from its parts.",
    "<9><83> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'If the body exists neither in the external objects nor in the internal faculties when examined through reasoning, how could there possibly be an intrinsically established body in the hands and so forth?' This verse demonstrates that when we search for the 'body' among all the outer six sense bases and their inner faculties, it cannot be found or observed.\n\n'If there is no body that has a separate essence from the hands and other parts, how could that body exist intrinsically?' Here the text shows that if there is nothing else apart from hands and so forth that serves as the basis of designation for the body, then the body as an independent entity cannot exist.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates two key points: first, that the body is not identical with its limbs (as shown in related verses like 'The leg is not the body...'); and second, that there is no separate entity that is related to its limbs (as shown in verses like 'If this body...').\n\nIn essence, these verses refute both possibilities: the body cannot be found as identical to its parts, nor can it be found as something separate from its parts. This demonstrates the ultimate absence of an intrinsically established body, challenging both Buddhist conceptions of an external agent and non-Buddhist assertions of an internal agent that performs actions.",
    "<9><84> Combined Commentary:\n\nTherefore, although the body does not exist inherently, there is a clear cause for our misapprehension of it. Though no intrinsically existent body can be found, due to ignorance or delusion about the true nature of hands, limbs, and other parts, one develops the mistaken notion that 'the body exists inherently.' This conception is merely a designation as 'body' without corresponding to any real entity, and what is apprehended by this conception is not true. The verse illustrates this with an apt example: just as when looking at a scarecrow that has been shaped to resemble a human form, due to its particular arrangement and specific circumstances, one generates the mistaken cognition perceiving the scarecrow as an actual person. In both cases, the mind superimposes an inherently existent entity where there is none, based solely on the particular arrangement of constituent parts.",
    "<9><85> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\nFor as long as the collection of conditions is assembled, this body appears like a person, similar to a scarecrow mistaken for a human. When these conditions are incomplete or absent, it is not established as a human body—just as when characteristics change, or in the case of an embryo, or when burned to ashes. Similarly, for as long as there exist the interdependent conditions for designating limbs such as hands and so forth as a body, for that duration these hands and other parts appear as a body. However, they do not exist as a body by their own nature—they are merely pieces of flesh and bone. When these causes and conditions are present, a mind arises that grasps the body as inherently established, although this is merely a deluded perception. The same principle applies to a woman's body as well, as it too lacks inherent existence.",

The parts are progressively broken down into smaller and smaller components, ultimately reaching the level of subtle particles.\n\n'རྡུལ་དེའང་ཕྱོགས་ཆའི་དབྱེ་བ་ཡིས། །' (And even that particle, through division into directional parts)\nAnd even that subtle particle, when divided into parts according to directions such as east, west, north, south, top, and bottom, becomes six parts. Since these particles are designated in dependence upon multiple directional components, they cannot be established by their own nature.\n\n'ཕྱོགས་དབྱེའང་ཆ་ཤས་དང་བྲལ་ཕྱིར། །' (The directional divisions too, being devoid of parts)\nWhen each of these directional divisions is further investigated, not even a single inherently established part can be found because each division becomes free from parts that are established by their own nature. The division into directional parts also lacks establishment by its own nature.\n\n'མཁའ་བཞིན་དེས་ན་རྡུལ་ཡང་མེད། །' (Like space, therefore, even particles do not exist)\nTherefore, all forms, when analyzed from gross to subtle, from subtle to particle, from particle to subtle particle, and further through directional divisions, become empty like space and are not established as inherently existent forms. Thus, there is not even the existence of truly established subtle particles. If particles did truly exist, one would have to accept partless atomic particles, but this is refuted by reasoning.",
    "<9><88> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThus, physical forms that appear to exist are like dreams - they appear yet have no inherent nature or true establishment. Who among those endowed with discerning wisdom would develop attachment to such dream-like forms? It would be completely inappropriate to be attached to something that cannot withstand rational scrutiny.\n\nWhen the body, in this way, lacks inherent existence, what meaningful distinction can be made between male and female? There is no inherently existent person, neither male nor female. They do not truly exist beyond mere designation by name and terminology.\n\nAccording to the system of this text, merely refuting a self-sufficient person is insufficient for understanding the selflessness of persons. One must comprehend that there is no person beyond mere conventional designation. There is no difference in difficulty between realizing the selflessness of persons and phenomena, as this tradition does not distinguish between coarse and subtle forms of the object of negation.\n\nJust as we have analyzed our own bodies, we should similarly establish that the bodies of other sentient beings and the outer environment—mountains, continents, and so forth—lack inherent nature, like space. Understanding this, one should abandon conceptual clinging and attachment, maintaining awareness of appearances as illusory during post-meditation while resting in a state free from elaborations during formal meditation.\n\nThe text now transitions to the second section concerning the cultivation of mindfulness with regard to feelings, which has four aspects: analysis of the nature of feelings themselves, analysis of their causes, analysis of their objects, and analysis of the subject who experiences feelings.",
    "<9><89> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf the feeling of suffering truly existed inherently within the mind or mental continuum, why would it not hinder the arising of great joy? As stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: 'If something exists by its own nature, it would never become non-existent; for something of inherent nature to transform into something else is never reasonable.' If suffering inherently existed within a single mental consciousness, it should not be able to transform into something else and would prevent feelings of joy from arising—but this is not consistently the case.\n\nSimilarly, if happiness truly existed inherently, it would be understood to counteract suffering. If happiness had inherent existence in reality, then why wouldn't those afflicted with intense grief from situations like the death of a child experience joy and happiness when consuming delicious food and such? They should experience pleasure since pleasantness would inherently exist in the objects themselves, like the heat of fire.\n\nIf one argues: 'At the time of being tormented by grief, happiness does arise, but because suffering is more powerful, it overwhelms the happiness, which is therefore not experienced,' we respond: How can something that is not experienced be a feeling of happiness? It cannot be, because the nature of feeling is to be experienced. Similarly, this same response applies to the claim that inherently existent suffering can be overwhelmed by powerful happiness.\n\nSince beautiful forms and sweet tastes do not inherently produce pleasure for those overwhelmed by grief or fear, it is clear that feelings of pleasure and pain do not truly exist either in the mind or in external objects.",
    "<9><90> Combined Commentary on Source Text\n\nThe source text raises a philosophical question about the nature of experience and sensation. Let me explain it sentence by sentence:\n\n'If that suffering is not experienced because it is overpowered by a stronger force...' - This first line addresses a situation where one sensation (suffering) might be overwhelmed by something more powerful.\n\n'If that [suffering] is not experienced...' - This line questions what happens when a sensation exists but is not consciously experienced.\n\n'That which does not have the nature of being experienced...' - Here, the text examines something fundamental about sensations - can something be a sensation if it's not actually experienced?\n\n'How can that be a sensation/feeling?' - This final line presents the central philosophical challenge: the very definition of a sensation is that which is experienced.\n\nThe commentaries collectively argue that if sensations like suffering or happiness truly existed inherently, they would always be experienced regardless of other mental states. Just as someone grieving wouldn't suddenly feel happiness from delicious food despite its 'inherently pleasant' nature, the overwhelming of one sensation by another challenges the idea of inherent existence. The key point is that the very definition of a feeling or sensation is 'that which is experienced' - so something that exists but is not experienced cannot properly be called a sensation, as it lacks the essential characteristic that defines what a sensation is.",
    "<9><91> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'In this regard, they think: 'Since something completely unexperienced cannot be felt, during the experience of intense joy, suffering is not completely absent but exists in a subtle form, which is not perceived. For example, it is like a tiny drop of salt water falling into a large amount of molasses syrup.''\n\nThere is indeed a subtle suffering that is experienced even during moments of pleasure. However, this raises a critical question: how can strong pleasure coexist with suffering in such a way that the suffering is somehow transformed into an experience of pleasure? The opponent claims that when intense pleasure arises, it cannot completely eliminate suffering, but only obscures it.\n\n'There cannot be a coexistence of subtle suffering and pleasure of equal strength in the same mental continuum. If there were, they should appear simultaneously in the mind, but this is not observed.' It is accepted that strong pleasure removes the coarse aspect of suffering, but what happens to the subtle aspect?\n\nAgain, someone might object: 'Although subtle suffering exists, it cannot manifest its power because it is transformed by great pleasure, so it is experienced merely as a slight joy different from that great pleasure. This is like white crystal appearing red when coated with red dust, though the white crystal itself does not cease to exist.'\n\nIf one argues that this subtle suffering is merely experienced as a slight enjoyment different from that great pleasure, then we must ask: if this so-called 'subtle suffering' is experienced as joy, how is it suffering at all? Even that subtle experience would not transcend the characteristics of pleasure. If it is subtle pleasure, it must be pleasure, not suffering. What distinguishes suffering experienced as subtle joy from joy itself experienced as subtle joy?\n\nThis pointless, forced investigation of something non-existent is like tying knots in the sky. The examples given, such as the salt water in molasses or the red-dusted crystal, are merely attempts to establish what is itself unestablished and do not prove the point that suffering somehow persists in a subtle form during experiences of pleasure.",
    "<9><92> Combined Commentary\n\nIf it is argued that 'when a contradictory condition—such as strong pleasure from pleasant food or drink—arises, suffering does not arise due to incomplete causes,' then isn't it established that feeling (vedanā) is merely a conceptual projection or mental imputation? This verse addresses the opponent's attempt to eliminate the fault mentioned earlier regarding the incompatibility of happiness with sorrow and torment.\n\nThe verse shows that feelings of pleasure and pain are merely fixated upon by conceptual thought rather than being inherently established entities. This is evident because when the mind experiences pleasure, suffering is absent, and when suffering arises, pleasure is absent—these mental states arise occasionally depending on conditions.\n\nTherefore, viewing pleasure and pain as inherently established phenomena and then striving to reject or acquire them is delusional. The same food and drink can be designated as causes of both pleasure and pain depending on one's conceptual thought—just as ghee appears differently to someone with a vomiting illness versus someone who is hungry, or as a woman's form appears differently to someone practicing unattractiveness meditation versus someone full of attachment.\n\nIn conclusion, the conception of feeling as inherently existent is indeed an attachment to error, since pleasure and suffering arise through the power of one's own conceptualization, without any inherently characterized entities existing from their own side.",
    "<9><93> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'དེ་ཉིད་ཕྱིར་ན་འདི་ཡི་ནི། །' (For this very reason) - For this very reason—because feelings are not inherently established—we need an antidote. Because of causes and conditions such as these, sentient beings become strongly attached to feelings such as pleasure as being real, causing continuous fluctuations of conceptual thoughts in the form of accepting and rejecting.\n\n'གཉེན་པོ་རྣམ་དཔྱོད་འདི་བསྒོམ་སྟེ། །' (this analytical investigation is to be cultivated as the antidote) - This analytical meditation should be cultivated as an antidote to the grasping at feelings as real. One should cultivate this kind of analytical investigation into how feelings are without inherent nature, as there is no other antidote for the turmoil of attachment to feelings that affects the entire worldly realm.\n\n'རྣམ་བརྟགས་ཞིང་ལས་བྱུང་བ་ཡི། །' (arising from the field of analytical investigation) - This refers to meditation arising from the excellent field of analytical investigation and examination. When one becomes accustomed to meditative concentration based on insight that focuses on the true nature of things, and develops calm abiding (śamatha) as a foundation for cultivating insight (vipaśyanā), one generates a profound realization.\n\n'བསམ་གཏན་རྣལ་འབྱོར་པ་ཡི་ཟས། །' (meditation is the nourishment of yogis) - This meditation is called 'food' or 'nourishment' because it causes the yogin's body of realization to increase and expand progressively. Just as ordinary food causes the physical body to grow, this meditative concentration causes the yogi's body of realized qualities to expand and produces dispassionate joy. After realizing emptiness, one should strive to remain in single-pointed equipoise, which further enhances the yogi's realization regarding the true nature of reality.",
    "<9><94> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nགལ་ཏེ་དབང་དོན་བར་བཅས་ན། །\nIf the faculties and their objects have space between them, where would they meet?\n\nThis verse examines the logical problem of contact between sense faculties (like the eye) and their objects (like forms). If there is space between the sense faculty and its object, then a genuine meeting or contact between them becomes impossible. This would be like mountains in the east and west that cannot meet due to their separation. Furthermore, within any intervening space, there would also be particles of either light or darkness, and those too would have spaces between them, leading to an infinite regress that makes true contact impossible.\n\nདེ་དག་གང་དུ་ཕྲད་པར་འགྱུར། །\nAnd if there is no space between them, they would be one and the same - so which would connect with which?\n\nThis verse continues the logical investigation. If we claim there is no space between the faculty and object, then they would necessarily become one entity. When two partless particles meet with no space between them, since they lack distinct sides of meeting and non-meeting, they would merge entirely at all points. In such a case, which entity could connect with which? For connection to occur, two separate things must exist, but here they would become a single entity. Just as it is impossible for an eye to connect with itself, so too would connection be impossible if the faculty and object became one.\n\nབར་མེད་ན་ཡང་གཅིག་ཉིད་དེ། །\nIf there is no intervening part whatsoever, they would become one entity.\n\nThis verse emphasizes that without any intervening space, the sense faculty and its object would lose their distinctness and become a single entity. An atomic particle cannot enter into or be absorbed by another atomic particle because there is no empty space between those atomic particles, and they are equal in size. Therefore, they cannot meet in their entirety at all points while maintaining their separateness.\n\nགང་ཞིག་གང་དང་ཕྲད་པར་འགྱུར། །\nSo which would connect with which?\n\nThe final verse concludes the argument by questioning how connection could occur at all. If faculties and objects are separate with space between them, they cannot meet across that space. If they have no space between them, they become a single entity, and there would be no duality of 'that which meets' and 'that which is met.' Someone might object: 'Couldn't there be contact like when two palms are joined together?' However, even what appears as contact here is merely conceptual imputation, not truly real. Gross sense faculties and objects do not make contact from all sides—if they connect in front, they do not connect in back, revealing that true contact is impossible.",
    "<9><95> Combined Commentary Explanation (Sentence by Sentence)\n\n'རྡུལ་ཕྲན་རྡུལ་ཕྲན་ལ་འཇུག་མེད། །' (One tiny particle does not enter into another tiny particle.)\n\nThis line explains that when we examine particles, one atomic particle cannot enter into or dissolve within another atomic particle. The sensory atoms and object atoms fundamentally cannot interpenetrate each other because, as partless entities, they have no mechanism for one to enter into the other.\n\n'དེ་ནི་སྐབས་མེད་མཉམ་པ་ཡིན། །' (This is because they have no empty space and are equal in size.)\n\nThe reason for this inability to enter is twofold: first, atomic particles have no empty space or gaps within them to accommodate another particle; second, they are exactly equal in size to each other. Being partless, there is no space for another to fit or enter—both are equal in this regard. This equality in size and lack of internal space makes interpenetration impossible.\n\n'མ་ཞུགས་པ་ལ་འདྲེས་མེད་ཅིང་། །' (Without entering, there can be no mixing.)\n\nSince particles cannot enter into each other, they cannot mix or combine into a single entity. If they cannot interpenetrate, they must remain distinct and separate. If two partless particles were to meet entirely with their whole nature, they would necessarily mix in the same space and become a single particle, but this is impossible because they cannot enter into each other.\n\n'མ་འདྲེས་པ་ལ་ཕྲད་པ་མེད། །' (Without mixing, there can be no contact.)\n\nThe final consequence of this analysis is that without mixing, true contact or meeting between partless particles is impossible. For partless entities to truly meet, they would have to meet in all directions or aspects simultaneously, not just on one side. If they could meet on just one side, this would imply they have parts (a meeting side and a non-meeting side), contradicting their partless nature. Since they cannot mix, they cannot have true contact. Therefore, what we perceive as contact between objects at the conventional level cannot be sustained under ultimate analysis of their atomic components.",
    "<9><96> Combined Commentary\n\nTherefore, how can it be reasonably maintained that something that is partless also has contact? The pervasion holds because when atoms do not enter into or dissolve into one another, there is no mixing, and where there is no mixing of partless entities, there can be no contact. Neither contact by one side nor contact by all sides is possible for it, for if this were the case, they would have two parts: one that makes contact and one that does not. If you claim that particles are partless, how could you reasonably speak of 'contact' with a single side? It is impossible. Thus, if you have seen that something can both be in contact and be partless, then demonstrate it to me—but you are unable to show such a thing. This is intended to establish that you cannot demonstrate how contact could be established, to the point of impossibility. Having shown that there is no coming together of object, sense faculty and consciousness in the sense of the meeting of faculty and object, the argument demonstrates the inherent contradiction in asserting both partlessness and contact simultaneously.",
    "<9><97> Combined Commentary\n\nConsciousness, being without a physical body (i.e., without form), does not reasonably have contact with objects. If something formless could have contact, absurd consequences would follow - there would be contact between space and a hand, or contact with the child of a barren woman. If one objects that consciousness exists unlike these examples, the analysis still stands because we're examining the logical impossibility of contact for anything formless.\n\nIf one further objects, 'Even without physical contact, there can still be a mere collection [of factors] for producing an effect,' this is not reasonable. Even that collection of object, sense faculty, and consciousness does not exist as a real entity. This is because even a collection lacks true substantiality or inherent existence, as was previously analyzed in passages discussing collections of parts (such as 'because it is a collection of fingers' and so forth).\n\nThis refutation applies to gross objects as well - for objects formed from an aggregation of particles, inherently established contact cannot exist because they lack true, inherent existence. This should be understood according to the examination already conducted in earlier analyses.",
    "<9><98> Combined Commentary\n\nThus, if the cause, contact, does not inherently exist as was previously explained (when the object, sense faculty, and consciousness meeting together are inherently non-existent), how could the effect, feeling, arise with true establishment? Since a false cause has no power to produce a truly established effect, ultimately feeling does not exist inherently.\n\nIf there is no inherently established feeling, then what purpose does all this various exhausting effort of accepting pleasure and rejecting pain serve? Such exertion or effort would be meaningless, as there is no truly established happiness to be sought after and accomplished.\n\nIf one objects, 'The exertion is for the purpose of eliminating inherently established suffering feelings,' this is untenable. From what object and to what person could harm occur, since there is no inherently established suffering feeling? There is neither something to be obtained nor anything that causes harm. Suffering is merely an illusory appearance of a deluded mind.\n\nIn this world, there is merely happiness that remedies suffering, but just as there is no intrinsically characterized suffering, there is also no intrinsically characterized happiness. For example, when someone affected by cold sits in the sun, the experience of comfort felt is the feeling of pleasure, yet even then the suffering of cold remains partially. When suffering ceases, the suffering of heat immediately begins without interruption. Therefore, by realizing feelings are not inherently established, craving will cease.",
    "<9><99> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nWhen the verse states 'When there is no experiencer whatsoever,' it refers to the absence of an inherently established experiencer of sensations—neither a self nor a consciousness that exists from its own side. \n\n'And sensation also does not exist' indicates that the sensations themselves have no intrinsic, independent existence.\n\n'Having seen this state' means comprehending this condition in which both the felt object and the feeler lack inherent existence in reality—the state of emptiness of both the experiencer and what is experienced.\n\n'Why would craving not cease?' suggests that upon recognizing this fundamental truth about the nature of reality, craving would naturally subside because the craving that desires to obtain happiness and the craving that desires to be free from suffering are both induced by the power of grasping at true existence. Since there is no inherently existing cause (sensation), there can be no inherently existing result (craving).\n\nThis represents the third point in the logical progression of the text, addressing how understanding emptiness leads to the cessation of craving, which binds beings to the cycle of suffering.",
    "<9><100> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'མཐོང་བ་འམ་ནི་རེག་པ་ཡང་།' (Seeing or touching)\nWhen the text speaks of 'seeing forms with the eyes or touching with the body,' these two sensory experiences—the beginning (seeing) and end (touching) of the sensory spectrum—represent all intermediate experiences as well, including hearing, smelling, and tasting. These five sense objects appear to consciousness but are empty of inherent existence.\n\n'རྨི་ལམ་སྒྱུ་འདྲའི་བདག་ཉིད་ཀྱིས།' (By nature like dreams and illusions)\nAlthough these objects appear to us, they are in reality unreal, being 'of the nature of dreams and illusions.' They are merely conceptual imputations that appear while being fundamentally untrue—like illusions that seem real but dissolve under analysis. The objects that give rise to feelings are empty by nature, and consequently, feelings themselves lack inherent nature.\n\n'སེམས་དང་ལྷན་ཅིག་སྐྱེས་པའི་ཕྱིར།' (Because they arise simultaneously with mind)\nThis line presents a crucial logical argument: feelings arise simultaneously with the mind that experiences them. This simultaneity creates a philosophical problem—since the experiencing mind and the experienced feeling arise together without temporal sequence, they have no prior relationship to one another.\n\n'ཚོར་བ་དེ་ཡིས་མཐོང་མ་ཡིན།' (That feeling is not [truly] seen)\nThe conclusion is that the feeling is not truly 'seen' or experienced by that mind. This is because distinct entities that arise simultaneously have no causal connection to each other. If they were separate substances occurring simultaneously, there would be no relationship between them. Alternatively, if the mind arose before or after the feeling, it would merely remember the feeling rather than directly experience it, because at that moment the feeling would have either ceased or not yet arisen. Therefore, feelings cannot be inherently experienced.",
    "<9><101> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse addresses how feelings are not truly experienced, either by oneself or others. The feelings that arose previously and minds that arise later only remember or recollect that feeling—they do not directly experience it. This is because at the time of the later mind, the previous feeling has already ceased to exist. Similarly, feelings that will arise in the future are merely anticipated but not experienced, as they don't yet exist.\n\nSince feelings arise simultaneously with mind, these feelings are not naturally seen by that mind either, as distinct substances occurring at the same time lack connection. All cognitions that take past objects are mere remembrances, and since what has passed no longer exists in the present, there can be no direct, clear experience of it. Therefore, upon analysis, even this remembrance is false, as the past itself does not remain as an object in the present.\n\nA feeling cannot logically experience itself or its own nature, as self-action is contradictory, just as self-awareness has been refuted. Because there is no duality of the experienced and the experiencer, one does not experience oneself. And feelings cannot be experienced by consciousnesses that are other than the feeling, because when examined in terms of the three times, it is not reasonable that others could experience it either.\n\nTherefore, no actual experiencer or feeler truly exists. Without an inherently established experiencer, there is also no inherently established person who feels, as this was already refuted in the section on refuting the self of persons. In reality, there is neither benefit nor harm in this dream-like, illusion-like aggregate of suffering feeling.",
    "<9><102> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'There is no experiencer or one who experiences sensations whatsoever in reality.' The commentary explains that there is no inherently existing experiencer of feelings because the notion of self-awareness has been refuted, and there can be no relationship between an inherently existing experiencer and what is experienced.\n\n'For this reason, the sensation itself does not ultimately exist.' Since there is no valid experiencer, the feeling itself cannot be ultimately established—it cannot experience itself (as self-awareness is refuted), nor can it be experienced by another inherently existing entity.\n\n'Thus, in this aggregate collection that is without a self—' This refers to the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness) which collectively lack any inherent self-nature, being like a dream or an illusion.\n\n'How could this suffering sensation, which has no inherent nature, cause harm?' When we understand that there is no inherently existing self within the aggregates, then we must question how suffering could truly harm or pleasure benefit something that fundamentally lacks inherent existence. In reality, there is no establishment of something that benefits or harms.\n\nThis section leads into the third part of the text which focuses on mindfulness of mind, which will be analyzed in two parts: first demonstrating that mental consciousness lacks inherent nature, and second showing that the five sense consciousnesses do not inherently exist.",
    "<9><103> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'The mind (consciousness) does not inherently exist nor abide in the six sense faculties such as the eye.' This means consciousness cannot be found residing within our sensory organs, as evidenced by the fact that even when these faculties are present, consciousness sometimes does not arise.\n\n'Nor is it present in the six outer objects such as form, and it is not found in between these two.' The mind is not located in external objects like visible forms, nor does it exist in the space between the senses and their objects (in their conjunction), as it cannot be observed there.\n\n'The mind is not found within the central parts of the body, nor is it found in the outer limbs of the body.' It does not inherently abide in what non-Buddhist philosophers might call the 'inner doer' or soul, nor is it located in external body parts like hands and limbs.\n\n'Nor is it to be found anywhere else apart from these.' The mind is neither mixed with the body nor independently established as separate from it—it cannot be established as inherently existent in any way whatsoever. This analysis follows the sevenfold chariot reasoning as explained in the Madhyamakāvatāra, showing that the mind that is empty of inherent nature is itself the natural nirvana.",
    "<9><104> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThat which is neither the body itself nor truly exists elsewhere apart from it refers to the mind, which cannot be found to inherently exist within the body or physical form. Nor is it mixed with the body means the mind is not something that combines with or enters into the physical form in an inherently existing way. Nor exists separately from the body anywhere indicates that the mind cannot be established as something that exists independently from the body in any location.\n\nThis mind does not exist even in the slightest degree as something truly real, which means it has no inherent existence whatsoever when subjected to analysis. Therefore, sentient beings are naturally beyond sorrow (parinirvāṇa), indicating that the empty nature of mind is itself the natural state of nirvāṇa.\n\nAs stated in the Ratnakūṭa Sūtra: 'The mind is not found within, nor is it found without, nor is it found in both places; it is not apprehended,' and 'Kāśyapa, the mind has not been seen, is not seen, and will not be seen by any of the Buddhas.' One should recall the sevenfold analysis of the chariot as explained in the Madhyamakāvatāra to understand how the mind, like the chariot, cannot be found under ultimate analysis. The Prajñāpāramitā further confirms this view, stating: 'Mind is no-mind; the nature of mind is luminosity.' Thus, sentient beings are primordially in a state of nirvāṇa because the mind's empty nature is itself the natural state beyond suffering.",
    "<9><105> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf visual consciousness or other sensory consciousness exists prior to its objects of knowledge such as form, then what object does that consciousness focus on to arise? At that time, since there is no object yet present, there cannot be the arising of a subject consciousness. \n\nAnd if consciousness and the object of knowledge arise simultaneously, then what does that consciousness focus on to arise? This creates a logical problem because if consciousness has not yet arisen, the observed condition has not arisen and thus cannot produce it; and if the observed condition has already arisen, then consciousness has also already arisen, so it would be inappropriate as a producer of consciousness.\n\nIf sensory consciousness exists after the object of knowledge, then from what condition does sensory consciousness inherently arise? This is also untenable. If it arises from a previous moment that has ceased, it would be like a sprout arising from a burnt seed. If it arises from a previous moment that has not ceased, either there would be a temporal gap making direct arising impossible, or there would be no gap at all, meaning they would merge into a single moment.\n\nTherefore, the five sense consciousnesses cannot logically exist prior to, simultaneously with, or after their objects of knowledge, proving they lack inherent existence. When consciousness has not yet arisen, its object has also not arisen; and when consciousness has arisen, it would not need to be produced by its object. These alternatives show that consciousness and its objects would become unrelated if they were truly existent.",
    "<9><106> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\n'If the object of knowledge existed after [the cognition], then how would the cognition arise?' This verse questions how cognition could arise if its object comes after it. Since the referential object would not yet exist, what would the cognition observe to arise? If cognition exists prior to its object, there would be nothing for it to perceive.\n\n'Then at that time, from what would the cognition arise?' This asks: if cognition arises after the object of knowledge has already ceased, what causal condition could produce this cognition? If it arises from something that has already ceased, it would be like a sprout growing from a burnt seed—impossible. If it were to arise from something that has not ceased, then either there must be temporal separation (making direct production impossible) or no separation (making them simultaneous, which creates other problems).\n\n'Thus, the arising of all phenomena cannot be ascertained.' This concludes that the arising of all conditioned and unconditioned dharmas cannot be established as inherently existent. They do not arise from self, other, both, or neither, nor can they arise from what is earlier, later, or simultaneous. This establishes the fourth mindfulness—the mindfulness of phenomena (dharmas).\n\nThis explanation forms part of the larger discussion on how all phenomena are established as unborn in ultimate reality. It also addresses potential objections to this view, particularly concerning how conventional reality characterized by arising and ceasing could exist if phenomena are ultimately unborn, and how the two truths can be maintained in the Madhyamaka system without contradiction.",
    "<9><107> Combined Commentary: Sentence-by-Sentence Explanation\n\nIf thus there is no conventional reality, then how could there be the two truths? If conventional reality exists in dependence on another convention, how could sentient beings ever attain nirvana?\n\nIf, as previously discussed, none of the knowable phenomena have any birth, cessation, and so forth whatsoever in any respect, then the conventional reality characterized by birth, cessation, coming, going, and so on would not exist. If establishment by own-characteristics is impossible, as was previously refuted regarding subject and object being designated as earlier and later, then there would be no basis for positing any phenomenon, resulting in the absence of the conventional. And for one who does not accept conventional reality, ultimate reality also does not exist, so how could both truths exist? Both would be non-existent, reducing everything to a single truth.\n\nNow, you might accept that forms, sounds, and so forth are true in relation to a conventional consciousness that conceives them to be established by their own characteristics, while not being true from the object's own side, thus existing conventionally. If so, your conventional existence would be like a snake that doesn't exist from the rope's side but exists as a snake in relation to the mind that conceives it as such - established merely by being conceived to exist by another consciousness. \n\nFurthermore, someone may object: 'If there is no truly existing conventional entity with its own characteristics, and 'conventional reality' must be established by another—that is, by another's mind—then how could sentient beings ever pass beyond sorrow? As long as sentient beings are endless, mind will be endless, and as long as mind is endless, the conventional reality established by mind will be endless.' For even if some had passed beyond sorrow, they would still become conventional beings due to being imputed as subject to arising and ceasing by others. In that case, what is called 'nirvana'—the exhaustion of all elaborations of subject and object—would never be possible.",
    "<9><108> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis verse discusses the relationship between conventional appearances, conceptual fabrication, and nirvana.\n\n'This is the conceptual fabrication of others' minds' - What we perceive as conventional existence is not simply what appears due to conceptual fabrications of other sentient beings' minds, which mistakenly apprehend phenomena as truly existent. These appearances are like dream-images or apparitions of floating hairs that arise from mental elaboration.\n\n'That is not one's own conventional [reality]' - Such conceptual fabrication by others is not what constitutes conventional existence in the Madhyamaka's own system. The conventional appearances in others' minds do not define what is conventionally real for someone who has attained nirvana, as nirvana itself is free from conceptual delusion. Just because others have dualistic appearances does not prevent one person from attaining nirvana.\n\n'If, afterward, one ascertains that it exists' - If, after attaining nirvana where subject-object duality has ceased, one were to ascertain through valid cognition that conventional phenomena like birth and cessation definitely exist, then that conventional reality would exist in relation to oneself. This is similar to how when one person awakens from a dream, only their own dream appearances cease, while others' dreams continue without conflicting with the awakened state.\n\n'If not, then conventional [reality] itself does not exist' - However, if at the time of nirvana one does not ascertain these conventional elaborations, then all conventional reality is completely non-existent for that person. This is the state of nirvana—like a fire whose fuel is exhausted, where all elaborations of mind and mental factors cease without remainder, resulting in the manifestation of ultimate wisdom, the dharmakāya of the Victorious Ones.",

This creates a potential problem.\n\n'Would become endless' points to the apparent infinite regress that would follow if every examining consciousness itself required examination by another consciousness. If the analytical mind needs another analytical mind to establish its own emptiness, and that second mind needs a third, we fall into an infinite series with no conclusion.\n\nThis verse presents a common objection to Madhyamaka reasoning: if all phenomena lack true existence and require valid cognition to establish this, then that valid cognition itself would need verification by another valid cognition, leading to an endless chain of validation with no foundation.\n\nHowever, the Madhyamaka response (implied but not stated in the verse) is that the valid cognition that realizes emptiness doesn't require another separate cognition to examine itself, as it realizes the emptiness of all phenomena including itself simultaneously. The analytical wisdom that realizes emptiness is itself empty of inherent existence, and this is understood without falling into infinite regress.",
    "<9><111> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen all phenomena that are objects of analysis have been thoroughly examined and found to be devoid of inherent existence, the analytical cognition that discerns this emptiness has no basis to grasp onto as 'this.' This means that when one becomes certain through analysis that phenomena do not abide in any extreme such as arising or non-arising, there remains no inherently existent foundation for further investigation.\n\nBecause there is no object of focus or basis, the subjective analytical cognition itself does not arise. This is because when all phenomena are recognized as lacking inherent existence, both the object being analyzed and the analyzing consciousness are pacified in non-arising. If another analyzing consciousness were needed to analyze the first one, this would lead to an infinite regress, which is impossible.\n\nThat analytical cognition, like waves subsiding into water, naturally enters a state beyond sorrow (nirvana) within the sphere of suchness. This is what is called natural nirvana, as stated: 'It is completely pacified through the absence of objectification.' When one realizes this meaning and cultivates it through meditation, one attains the nirvana that is freedom from adventitious defilements.\n\nThis verse forms part of the third topic, cutting through superimpositions through reasoning, which includes refuting the proofs of those who assert real entities and setting forth the proofs of those who assert emptiness.",

This verse begins by questioning the foundation of knowledge, asking if knowledge is established based on knowable objects, but immediately challenges this by questioning the basis for these objects' existence.\n\n'What support is there for the existence of objects of knowledge?' The commentary continues to press on this circular logic problem, pointing out that if consciousness is said to be established from objects, we must then ask what establishes the objects themselves.\n\n'The basis for it is knowledge.' Here, the obvious circular reasoning is exposed - knowledge depends on objects, yet objects depend on knowledge.\n\n'If it is claimed that the object and knowledge exist in mutual dependence, with one being established by the power of the other, then such existence is not established by its own nature but exists by the power of mutual dependence, like something being long or short.' This clarifies that if we claim objects and knowledge establish each other through mutual dependence, then neither has independent existence.\n\n'It is thereby clearly established that both lack inherent existence, just like long and short, or this shore and the far shore.' The commentaries all converge on this point, using the examples of relative concepts like 'long and short' or 'this shore and far shore' to illustrate how objects and cognitions lack independent existence.\n\n'Therefore, when trying to establish one of them, the other cannot serve as an example because it is not yet established. Thus, ultimately, both would be non-existent.' The commentary concludes that this mutual dependence proves that neither knowledge nor objects can truly exist inherently on their own.

For self-awareness has already been refuted, and no other agent of awareness has been accepted. This demonstrates that for those who accept real entities, conventional designations are difficult to justify.\n\nThis verse is part of a larger argument against causeless production, which is one of several approaches to establishing selflessness. The overall structure includes the vajra-splinter reasoning, the dependent origination reasoning, and the reasoning refuting arising from existence and non-existence.

'Direct perception' here is not limited to just sensory perception but also includes inference and other valid means of knowledge. The distinctions in lotus stems—their colors, sizes, number of petals, quantities, and other variations in the results—are produced by different types of causes. If one questions whether diverse causes for these differences are acceptable (since these differences might not be observable in the causes themselves), consider that if effects were already fully established within their causes, the very notion of a cause-effect relationship would be undermined. Since lotus stems and other such phenomena are never observed to arise without depending on their seeds but are always seen to arise from appropriate seeds, we can conclude that differences in effects are necessarily produced by differences in causes. Therefore, these phenomena, as the subject of our analysis, cannot be without causes, because they are observed to arise only occasionally in specific places and times. Just as there are various effects, so too must the diverse potentialities exist in their respective causes.",

The commentary explains that these distinctions naturally arise from prior causal sequences.\n\n'If one asks why this particular barley seed (or cause) can produce a barley sprout (or effect) with its various capacities, but cannot produce a rice seed' - This elaborates on why specific causes produce specific effects, using the example of how a barley seed specifically produces barley and not rice.\n\n'it is not because the present barley seed independently chooses among various potentials. Rather, it is because it has been propelled by the power of previous causes to produce something similar to itself' - The specific causal abilities of things don't come from independent choice but from the power and pattern of previous causes. A barley seed produces barley because of its causal history.\n\n'If one asks why different causes can produce different effects, it is because arising in such a manner from the power of each one's previous causes is the natural law of phenomena' - The ability of causes to produce their specific effects comes from the power of their respective previous causes, which follows natural laws, not random occurrences.\n\n'Therefore, if things were without causes, they would absurdly have to either always exist or never exist, but since entities are observed to occur only occasionally in specific places and times, they are established as having causes' - This establishes that things must have causes because they arise occasionally in specific contexts rather than existing permanently or never existing at all.\n\nThe commentary then transitions to the next section, which will refute three incorrect views about causation: production from Īśvara (a creator deity), from permanent atoms, and from Pradhāna (primordial substance).",

Something that produces effects must itself be impermanent, while that which is truly permanent would be entirely devoid of causal efficacy.",
    "<9><127> Combined Commentary\n\nThose Vaiśeṣika and Mimamsaka (non-Buddhist schools) who assert that atoms (paramāṇu) are permanent and the cause of the world have already been refuted earlier by the reasoning that refutes partless atoms, specifically by the statement 'Even those atoms can be divided into directional parts.' Since this matter has already been addressed, there is no need to further press down on what is already dead.\n\nRegarding the third point—the refutation of self-production (svayaṃbhūti)—there are two parts: refutation of pradhāna (primordial nature) and the actual refutation of self-production.\n\nFirst, presenting the Sāṃkhya position: The Sāṃkhyas assert that pradhāna, which possesses five characteristics—being permanent, singular, material/insentient, invisible to the ordinary eye, and the agent of all things—is the cause of the world. According to them, all knowable objects are definitively enumerated as twenty-five in number, divided into two main categories: the self-aware Self and the insentient Primordial Nature.\n\nThe essence of Primordial Nature consists of three qualities—sattva (light/goodness), rajas (activity), and tamas (darkness/inertia)—which correspond to pleasure, pain, and neutrality, existing in perfect equilibrium. This equilibrium state is called 'primordial nature' (pradhāna). When these three qualities are not in equilibrium, this imbalance produces 'the world' or 'transformations.'\n\nFrom this imbalance first emerges Intellect (mahat), then Ego-consciousness (ahaṃkāra), and from that arise the eleven faculties (five cognitive faculties, five action faculties, and mind) plus the five subtle elements—constituting sixteen collections. From the five subtle elements arise the five gross elements (space, air, fire, water, and earth). In total, these twenty-two entities are the transformational effects of pradhāna.\n\nThe refutation will consist of several parts: refuting that primordial nature is singular; refuting that it is eternal; refuting that pleasure, etc., are external objects; and refuting that newly produced effects that did not exist before are impossible.",

These three qualities constitute the unconscious primordial substance.\n\n'བྱ་བའི་ཡོན་ཏན་མཉམ་གནས་ནི། །' (When these qualities abide in equilibrium): When these three qualities exist in perfect balance or equilibrium, they form a specific state.\n\n'གཙོ་བོ་ཞེས་བྱར་རབ་བརྗོད་དེ། །' (This is declared to be pradhāna): This balanced state is what Sāṃkhya philosophers designate as 'pradhāna' or the Primary Principle - the permanent, singular, unconscious causal substance that serves as the fundamental source of all worldly manifestations.\n\n'མི་མཉམ་འགྲོ་བ་ཡིན་པར་བརྗོད། །' (When unbalanced, it is declared to be the world): When these three qualities fall out of equilibrium, this imbalance produces transformations (vikāra) that manifest as the diverse phenomena of the world.

This is analogous to the impossibility of a pot without clay, as the resultant transformations cannot exist without their causal qualities. Furthermore, if the primordial nature (pradhāna) with its three balanced qualities does not exist, then sound and so forth would be extremely distant from existence, because the five tanmātras (subtle elements) are accepted as transformations of the primordial nature. Regarding the second half of the verse, since insentient material objects like clothing lack consciousness, it follows that it is impossible for pleasure and so forth to exist in them. If feeling is established by valid cognition as being of the nature of mind, then the possibility of pleasure and so forth existing in non-sentient objects such as clothing, etc., is impossible. The five sense-objects such as cloth and so forth, as the subject, cannot possibly have pleasure and the like as identical with their nature, because they are inanimate.",
    "<9><131> Combined Commentary\n\nIf you say 'There is no fault [in our position] because material things like sound and cloth are of the nature of [being] the cause of happiness and so forth,' [we respond]: Have not material things like cloth already been analyzed and refuted as ultimately non-existent when refuting the body and so forth? They have indeed been refuted.\n\nSince material objects are without consciousness and inert, it follows that in subjects such as cloth, etc., the properties of pleasure and so forth cannot possibly exist as inherently one in substance. We have already refuted their true existence.\n\nThis also contradicts what you yourself have accepted conventionally, since you hold that the cause of cloth and the like is happiness, etc., and you also hold that the effects of cloth and the like are happiness, etc. According to your view, if the cause of cloth and other materials is the primordial nature (pradhāna) of equally balanced pleasure and so forth, then from that primordial nature, cloth and other materials cannot arise, because such a primordial nature is impossible.\n\nThus, to say that happiness is both the cause that produces cloth, etc., and also the effect produced by cloth, etc., is laughable—it's like saying 'This man is both his own father and his own son.' If there are many [instances of] happiness, etc., then their having a single nature fails.\n\nMoreover, if pleasure and so forth arise from cloth and similar materials, then when cloth and similar materials later cease to exist, the primordial nature with its equally balanced pleasure and so forth would also cease to exist, since an effect cannot exist without a cause. This is unacceptable because you have accepted the primordial nature as permanent and real.\n\nIt also contradicts direct perception, for we never observe cloth and the like arising from happiness, etc.",
    "<9><132> Combined Commentary\n\nFrom cloth, sandalwood garlands, and similar objects, experiences of pleasure and so forth are perceived. However, since these objects like 'cloth and so forth' are not established even as subtle particles and do not truly exist, the pleasure and other sensations that arise from them cannot exist independently elsewhere. \n\nIf someone objects: 'Pleasure and so forth don't need to depend on cloth and other objects because they are the permanent nature of Pradhāna (the Prime Cause),' then it creates a logical problem. If pleasure were truly permanent, it should be perceived invariably as permanent, since pleasure is perceptible and cannot deviate from its fundamental nature. Yet, pleasure is never observed to be permanent by any valid cognition.\n\nFurthermore, if Pradhāna consists of pleasure and other qualities in equilibrium, and is the cause of cloth and other things, then when cloth and such objects cease to exist, the Pradhāna consisting of pleasure and other qualities in equilibrium would also cease to exist, because an effect cannot exist without its cause. This contradicts the Sāṃkhya position that accepts Pradhāna as a permanent substance.\n\nAdditionally, if instances of pleasure were permanent entities, one would continue to experience pleasure even when suffering arises, but this is never the case. Some might argue: 'Although pleasure always exists, there is a distinction between its manifest and unmanifest states, so it isn't always perceived.' However, how could a permanent entity transition from gross to subtle after abandoning its previous state? This would be impossible for something truly permanent. Since pleasure and other qualities undergo change between gross and subtle states, they must be impermanent.\n\nTherefore, conventionally, happiness and the like arise from things such as cloth, but upon analysis, because the cause (cloth, etc.) lacks true existence, its result (happiness, etc.) lacks true existence as well.",
    "<9><133> Combined Commentary\n\nWhen analyzing the nature of happiness, pleasure, and similar phenomena, we can establish that they are never permanent entities. The verse questions: 'If pleasure and so forth were truly manifest and existing inherently, why would they not always be apprehended by consciousness?' If pleasure were a permanent, inherently existing entity that is continuously manifest, we would expect to experience it at all times, even when suffering arises. However, this contradicts our direct experience, where pleasure comes and goes.\n\nThe opponent might respond that pleasure itself becomes subtle during times of suffering and thus isn't experienced. This leads to the second half of the verse, which asks: 'If that very pleasure becomes subtle, how can it be both coarse and subtle?' How could something that is permanent and singular exist in two contradictory states? A permanent entity cannot have changing attributes, yet pleasure clearly manifests as coarse (when experienced) and subtle (when not experienced). This implies that pleasure must change, abandoning coarseness to become subtle and vice versa, which directly contradicts any claim of permanence.\n\nSince pleasure and similar phenomena are intermittent experiences that transform between manifest and unmanifest states, they cannot be permanent, inherently existing entities but must be impermanent, dependent phenomena.",

When an experience of pleasure transforms from gross to subtle, this very transformation proves its impermanence, as something truly permanent could not undergo such changes in manifestation.\n\n**'ཕྲ་རགས་དེ་དག་མི་རྟག་ཉིད། །' (Those subtle and gross states are themselves impermanent)**\n\nThose very pleasure and other experiences that exist in subtle and gross forms are established as impermanent by their very nature of transitioning between states. If pleasure were truly permanent, it would be impossible for it to have both gross and subtle manifestations, as a permanent entity cannot change its mode of appearance. The fact that these states fluctuate proves they are impermanent phenomena.\n\n**'དེ་བཞིན་དངོས་པོ་ཐམས་ཅད་ནི། །' (Similarly, all entities)**\n\nSimilarly, all entities and phenomena, including the twenty-five fundamental principles asserted by the Sāṃkhya philosophers, must be subject to the same reasoning. If you accept that pleasure can transform from one state to another while maintaining its permanence, this contradictory position could equally be applied to all entities.\n\n**'མི་རྟག་ཉིད་དུ་ཅིས་མི་འདོད། །' (Why would one not accept them as impermanent?)**\n\nWhy would you not accept that all entities are impermanent? They should logically be accepted as such because their nature transforms into different states. It is impossible for anything to be observed as having only one single, unchanging mode of appearance constantly. If the opponent claims, 'Even though pleasure becomes subtle and gross, since it does not abandon its essential nature, it does not deviate from permanence,' this fails because if gross pleasure disappears, either pleasure itself should still be experienced (which contradicts experience), or pleasure itself must also be impermanent (which contradicts their assertion of permanence).",
    "<9><135> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIf gross form and pleasure are two different things, then even when the gross form ceases, clear pleasure should not cease but should be experienced perpetually, which contradicts our experience. But if you assert that gross form is not different from pleasure but identical to it, then pleasure is clearly, that is definitely, impermanent. This undermines your position that the nature of pleasure is permanent.\n\nRegarding the second point, an opponent argues: 'Even when pleasure is not manifest, it exists in a latent, potential form within primordial matter (pradhāna), and when it later becomes manifest, it is merely the appearance of what already existed. This is because nothing that previously did not exist at all can arise, due to its non-existence. Just as a rabbit's horn cannot be produced from clay or oil cannot come from sand. Therefore, whatever appears in the realm of manifestation must have already existed within primordial matter by its very nature.'\n\nIf you maintain that effects exist at the time of their causes, then I ask: why are all effects not perceived at all times? If you say, 'Although its nature existed previously, its manifestation, which was previously unclear to the mind, becomes clearly manifest,' then you have already accepted that the clear manifestation arises newly without having existed at the time of the cause.\n\nTherefore, even though you do not wish to accept the arising of something previously non-existent, that very position is already established in your argument. You merely reject the terminology while accepting the meaning. For even though you do not accept or acknowledge that manifestation is newly produced without having existed at the time of the cause, in reality this is indeed the case.\n\nIf manifestation existed at the time of the cause, the distinction between manifest and unmanifest could not be established, as it would have been manifest from the beginning. Thus, your position contains an internal contradiction and contradicts reason, for if effects actually existed within their causes, then when you eat grain, you would be eating excrement.",

If the effect truly existed at the time of the cause, then the distinction between manifest and unmanifest states could not be established, as the effect would absurdly be manifest from the beginning.\n\nཟན་ཟ་མི་གཙང་ཟ་བར་འགྱུར། །\nIf effects inherently resided in their causes as non-different in nature, then it would absurdly follow that when eating food (such as rice), you would be eating impure substances.

This absurd consequence follows because, in the Sāṃkhya system, the intrinsic nature of cloth and the intrinsic nature of cotton seeds would be considered indivisibly identical.

The Sāṃkhyas argue that worldly people fail to perceive that cloth already exists in cotton seeds due to their ignorance, which is why they don't wear cotton seeds as clothing. This is their attempt to defend their philosophical position that effects pre-exist in their causes.\n\n'དེ་ཉིད་ཤེས་ཀྱིས་བཞག་དེ་ཉིད། །' (That very reality established by those who know reality...)\n\nThis second line points out the contradiction in the Sāṃkhya position by noting that even their own teachers who claim to know reality (like the sage Kapila who is considered omniscient in their tradition) still wear cotton garments rather than cotton seeds. If cloth truly pre-existed in seeds as they claim, then those who 'know reality' should logically be wearing seeds as clothing. Furthermore, according to the Sāṃkhya system itself, the knowledge of reality (that effects exist at the time of their causes) should be accessible to worldly people as well, so why don't they perceive cloth in seeds? This demonstrates that the effect does not actually exist at the time of the cause, contradicting a fundamental tenet of Sāṃkhya philosophy.",

Given that all necessary conditions are complete, they should logically see the effect existing at the time of the cause, but they clearly don't.\n\n'Given that all the causes are complete—they should see it.' - Even your own Sāṃkhya teachers like the sage Kapila, whom you consider omniscient, have established the principle that effects exist at the time of their causes.

The measuring valid cognition itself is false, so its object must likewise be false.\n\nFor this very reason, they claim that when one ascertains through analytical valid cognition that phenomena are empty in reality or ultimately, and then meditates on emptiness, that meditation would not be tenable. How can you assert that emptiness meditation is unerroneous when the valid cognition that measures it is itself false?\n\nIn response, we Mādhyamikas accept that it is entirely appropriate that both the valid cognition measuring emptiness and the emptiness established by it are conventionally true but ultimately false. This is because the determination of a negation—the conceptual negation of truly existent entities—depends on the appearance of the object of negation's aspect.

Just as one cannot conceptualize the death of a barren woman's son without first conceptualizing the son himself, without the aspect of true existence appearing to the conceptual mind, that entity's lack of true existence cannot be apprehended by conceptual thought.\n\n'Therefore, whatever entity is false, its non-entity is clearly false as well.'\n\nSince the object of negation—the falsely existing entity or inherent existence—is impossible and merely imagined, the negation of that object (emptiness) is also not truly established. When the negated object is itself false or illusory, the non-existence that results from negating it is clearly false as well. This aligns with the principle in Madhyamaka that if there were anything non-empty, emptiness itself would have to be truly established, which contradicts its own nature.\n\nThis reveals a profound point about emptiness: to ascertain it properly, one must be skilled in identifying the measure of the object of negation. We do not posit emptiness as some truly existent, objectifiable entity. Rather, emptiness itself is empty of inherent existence, even while it serves as the ultimate nature of phenomena. Thus, both entities and their emptinesses are conventionally valid yet ultimately without inherent existence.",

Yet even that thought itself is false. Both existence and non-existence in this context are false. This illustrates how a false antidote can overcome a false object of abandonment - just as in the dream, the non-existence conception obstructs the existence conception, though both are equally unreal. Similarly, merely becoming accustomed to the non-inherent existence of phenomena serves as an antidote to the grasping at true existence which has bound us to cyclic existence since beginningless time. Just as fire produced by rubbing two sticks together burns both sticks, the wisdom that analytically examines all phenomena as lacking true existence burns up the entire forest of all referential objects established as either existent or non-existent. This leads to the Great Middle Way, free from all assertions, where one abides in the wisdom that pacifies all conceptual elaborations. As the Madhyamaka Śāstra states: 'The statement 'it exists' is grasping at permanence; the statement 'it does not exist' is the view of annihilation. Therefore, the wise do not dwell in either existence or non-existence.'",

For during the time of non-existence, it has not arisen as an entity.\n\nMoreover, if we consider that an entity must change by abandoning or relinquishing the state of non-existence to become existent, we face another problem: without having first arisen or been produced as an entity, it could not become separated from non-existence. And if it is not separated from non-existence, the state of existing as an entity is impossible, because the two states—existence and non-existence—are contradictory and mutually exclusive.",
    "<9><149> Combined Commentary on the Verse\n\n**དངོས་མེད་དང་ནི་མ་བྲལ་ན། །**\nIf a thing is not free from non-existence—that is, without having abandoned the state of non-existence—then there cannot be any occasion for the existence of an entity. When non-existence remains, existence cannot simultaneously occur, as these two states are contradictory to each other. So when would existence ever arise, since during the time of non-existence, the existent thing has not yet come into being?\n\n**དངོས་པོ་ཡོད་པའི་སྐབས་མི་སྲིད། །**\nIt is impossible for existence to occur while non-existence persists, as these two extremes cannot coexist due to their mutual exclusivity. If something were to transform into existence after abandoning non-existence, the question arises: how could non-existence transform into existence? This would be logically impossible because before arising, the existent thing would not be separate from non-existence, and if it is not separate from non-existence, the possibility of existence cannot manifest.\n\n**དངོས་པོའང་མེད་པར་འགྱུར་མིན་ཏེ། །**\nJust as non-existence does not transform into existence, similarly, an existent thing does not transform into non-existence after ceasing. If at the time of cessation it is not separated from existence, how could it simultaneously be non-existent? And if it were truly separated from existence, this would contradict its being truly established during its existence, as it is said: 'If it existed by its own nature, it could never become non-existent.'\n\n**རང་བཞིན་གཉིས་སུ་ཐལ་འགྱུར་ཕྱིར། །**\nIf something were half existent and half non-existent, it would absurdly follow that a single entity would be established as having two contradictory natures simultaneously. This would lead to the impossible consequence that one entity possesses two mutually exclusive natures—both existence and non-existence. Through these logical analyses, we can refute the inherent arising of all phenomena, as neither that which inherently exists nor that which inherently does not exist can truly arise.",

Just as dream images seem real during sleep yet dissolve upon waking, the diverse appearances of transmigrations and existences seem solid but are not ultimately real. As the Samādhirāja Sūtra confirms: 'The states of existence are like dreams; in this, there is no birth and no one dies.'\n\n'རྣམ་པར་དཔྱད་ན་ཆུ་ཤིང་འདྲ། །' (When analyzed, they are like plantain trees.)\nWhen all phenomena are examined with reasoning that investigates ultimate reality, they are found to be like plantain trees—appearing solid from the outside but hollow and without essence within. This analysis begins when one is not satisfied with mere conventional designations and searches for how things truly exist. The King of Samādhi Sūtra states: 'Just as a person seeking the core of a fresh plantain tree trunk might split it open, but finds no essence either inside or outside, know that all phenomena are likewise.'\n\n'མྱ་ངན་འདས་དང་མ་འདས་པའང་། །' (Nirvana and non-nirvana too,)\nNirvāṇa, which is liberation from bonds such as attachment, and saṃsāra (non-nirvana), which represents imprisonment in cyclic existence, are conventionally presented as opposites. One represents freedom while the other represents bondage.\n\n'དེ་ཉིད་དུ་ནི་ཁྱད་པར་མེད། །' (In reality, there is no difference.)\nHowever, in terms of ultimate reality (de nyid), there is no difference between nirvana and saṃsāra, because both existence and peace are equal in being empty of inherent nature. They always abide in perfect equanimity, without true bondage or liberation. As stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: 'Between these two, not even the slightest subtle difference exists.' The Noble Upāliparipṛcchā teaches: 'When measured against the nature of phenomena, there are no results and no attainment of results.' This understanding constitutes one of the three doors of liberation and should compel us to equalize our minds toward the eight worldly concerns while generating great compassion for those who have not yet realized this profound truth.",
    "<9><152> Combined Commentary\n\nIn this verse, the text inquires about the nature of phenomena that are empty of inherent existence. Among such inherently empty phenomena, what genuine gain—such as food, clothing, or other desirable objects—could there actually be that would cause attachment? And similarly, what true loss could there be that would give rise to anger? Indeed, when examined from the perspective of their ultimate nature, there is nothing whatsoever to gain or lose. Furthermore, the verse questions: by which sentient being could honor and respect be shown, or who could express disdain and complete contempt? If all phenomena lack inherent existence, what benefit or harm could possibly come from someone paying respect or showing contempt? In reality, there is no inherently existent person who praises or honors, nor is there one who completely disdains—all are merely empty of intrinsic nature.",
    "<9><153> Combined Commentary\n\n'Where does happiness and suffering come from?'

When examining the causes of happiness and suffering through careful analysis, we discover they have no inherent or self-established nature.\n\n'What is there to dislike, and what is there to like?' This challenges our conventional notions of pleasant and unpleasant experiences. What inherent quality exists in things we label as disagreeable that makes them truly worthy of aversion? Similarly, what intrinsic nature exists in things we find agreeable that makes them inherently desirable?\n\n'When searching in terms of the ultimate truth...' This line directs us to investigate reality itself through proper reasoning. When we apply analytical meditation to examine the nature of phenomena, we find no self-established reality in our experiences.\n\n'Who is it that craves and what is craved?' This final line points to the emptiness of both subject and object. Upon investigation, neither the person who experiences craving, the act of craving itself, nor the object toward which craving is directed can be found to exist inherently. The three spheres of craving—the craver, the act of craving, and the object craved—are all empty of self-nature. Therefore, one should abandon attachment to the eight worldly dharmas (gain and loss, pleasure and pain, praise and blame, fame and disgrace) and rest in the profound emptiness of all phenomena.",

And who truly is kin or relative who benefits us, and who is truly a friend or beloved companion? Not even the slightest inherent existence can be found in any of these persons or phenomena. Having comprehended the meaning of the ultimate nature - that all these designations lack intrinsic reality - one should strive to remain equanimous toward the eight worldly dharmas (praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, fame and disrepute).

    "<9><169> Combined Commentary Explanation for the Source Text\n\nThe source text represents the title of the ninth chapter of Śāntideva's 'Bodhicaryāvatāra' (Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life), specifically identifying the chapter on the Perfection of Wisdom (Prajñāpāramitā).\n\nThe wisdom that realizes emptiness is the supreme perfection, as it directly addresses the root cause of suffering. While generosity provides resources, ethical discipline ensures higher rebirth, and meditation pacifies afflictions, it is wisdom alone that eliminates both afflictive and cognitive obscurations completely.\n\nThis profound wisdom realizes all phenomena as naturally empty of inherent existence. When one comprehends that all phenomena lack the three spheres of reference (agent, action, and object) and are free from conceptual elaborations, one's practice of merit accumulation through generosity and other virtues becomes even more meaningful and effective.\n\nFor practitioners on the path, seeing how sentient beings suffer in samsara due to their attachment to true existence naturally gives rise to great compassion. One thinks: 'How wonderful it would be if I could authentically teach emptiness to sentient beings who have been ruined in the three realms solely due to the poison of grasping at true existence.'\n\nThe 'I' that we conventionally grasp is merely imputed upon the aggregates; it lacks inherent nature or independent establishment. All phenomena exist only through dependent origination and nominal designation, without any intrinsic nature of their own.\n\nTo realize this Middle Way free from extremes, one needs guidance from a qualified spiritual teacher, as this profound understanding cannot be gained independently. Through proper hearing, contemplation, and meditation on emptiness as dependent origination, one should strive diligently on this path.\n\nThis tradition of understanding the two truths as taught by Nagarjuna is rare and precious. Those with discernment should quickly generate diligence in studying and practicing this wisdom, as it is the ultimate antidote to all suffering and the direct cause of liberation."

Who is dedicating? Previously it was Śāntideva, the original author, and now it is ourselves—'I,' which includes anyone engaging with this text. \n\nWhat is being dedicated? Śāntideva dedicated the virtue of contemplating and engaging in the Bodhisattva conduct—namely the aspiration of generating the supreme mind of enlightenment and the practice of implementing the six perfections. Similarly, we dedicate the virtue gained from engaging with this text 'Entering the Bodhisattva's Way of Life' through the ten dharma practices such as writing the text, making offerings, giving, and so forth.\n\nThe text itself condenses the entire subject matter of Buddhist scriptures into the path and its results by which a practitioner attains Buddhahood. It thoroughly elaborates the stages of the path through entering the bodhisattva conduct.\n\nAlthough Śāntideva already dedicated all virtues accumulated in the three times through this text with non-referential threefold purity, we should mix our own roots of virtue with his, like adding drops of water to a great ocean, and dedicate them together. As stated in the Sūtra Requested by Sāgaramati: 'Just as a drop of water falling into the great ocean will not be exhausted until the ocean dries up, likewise, virtuous deeds dedicated to enlightenment will not be exhausted until enlightenment is attained.'\n\nThe dedication is for all sentient beings equal to space to generate the mind aspiring to supreme enlightenment and properly engage in the Bodhisattva conduct of the six perfections such as generosity. Since great enlightenment cannot arise without its causes, dedicating for attaining enlightenment and dedicating for practicing its causes have the same meaning.\n\nThis dedication should be practiced with aspiration prayer ('May it be so'), with longing ('How wonderful it would be'), with commitment ('I shall make it happen'), and with supplication ('May the Guru and Three Jewels bless me'). When expressed in mind and speech, the Guru and Buddhas respond, 'May it be so,' providing conducive conditions.\n\nThe benefits of dedication are that virtuous actions that would produce only small results will produce vast ones, and those that would be exhausted if not dedicated will never be exhausted but will increase. Therefore, one should strive to dedicate even the slightest virtuous deeds to supreme enlightenment for all beings.",

By the power of my own virtue, may all beings who presently enjoy physical and mental happiness with great power, wealth, and authority in the world realms never lose these pleasures and joys for as long as they remain in saṃsāra. In some translations, the first line appears as 'until attaining Buddhahood,' but the meaning remains the same.\n\nThe verse also dedicates for freedom from the suffering that pervades all conditioned existence: May all limitless sentient beings throughout space be freed from the sufferings of pervasive conditioning and attain the continuous, uninterrupted joy of bodhisattvas who have attained non-abiding nirvāṇa.\n\nAs stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra: 'The happiness of giving that comes from stable, compassionate generosity cannot be matched even by a fraction by those who enjoy the pleasures of the three realms.' This verse aspires that sentient beings continuously obtain such happiness of the bodhisattvas without interruption.\n\nThis dedication is part of a larger structure that continues with prayers for beings in specific realms, particularly dedicating for the sake of lower realms (hell beings, animals, and hungry ghosts) and higher realms.

These realms are created by karma such as stealing ritual implements or taking others' clothing. The entire environment consists of snow mountains and ice, with fierce blizzards from all directions and perpetual darkness. The beings there have extremely sensitive bodies, are completely naked, and endure unbearable sensations. Their bodies develop blisters from extreme cold, which burst into sores; they wail 'Achu! Achu!'; their teeth chatter uncontrollably; their skin turns blue and splits like utpala flowers; their flesh protrudes and splits into multiple parts like lotus flowers. Iron-beaked worms enter these wounds and devour their flesh.

These beings take rebirth there due to hatred and similar causes. Their environment consists entirely of burning iron with leaping flames, where even the mildest hell fire is hotter than the cosmic fire that destroys the universe. The beings have enormous, sensitive bodies subjected to unbearable tortures: they attack each other with weapons, are sawed along black lines drawn on their bodies, crushed between iron mountains, burned in sealed houses, impaled with flaming spikes, and eventually become indistinguishable from the burning ground itself. Their lifespans range from 500 hell years (equivalent to millions of human years) to a full intermediate eon of uninterrupted suffering.

Upon arriving, they suffer terribly as their bodies are cut and slashed by sharp double-edged sword-like leaves while being chased and devoured by ferocious wild dogs. Through the power of virtue, may this terrifying forest transform into a delightful pleasure grove like Nandanavana (the divine garden of Indra and the Thirty-Three gods), becoming a place of perfect happiness rather than torment.\n\n**'And may even the thorny cotton trees be born as wish-fulfilling trees.'**\n\nThe Śālmali (cotton) trees with their sixteen-inch iron thorns pointing downward are a principal result of sexual misconduct.

In this realm, fallen warriors perceive each other as enemies, and whatever they grasp karmically transforms into weapons with which they attack one another, experiencing the boundless suffering of dying and reviving countless times. May this violence transform from today onward into the innocent, playful throwing of flowers.\n\nThis prayer of transformation also extends to harsh speech, false accusations, and curses in our world, which karmically manifest as these hellish experiences. Just as arguments and discord during meal gatherings can result in suffering through rains of burning weapons in future lives, the aspiration here is that all such negative actions and their consequences be transformed into beauty and joy.

    "<10><16> Combined Commentary\n\nThe prayer wishes that all animals may be free from the fear of devouring one another. In the vast oceans and across land, countless water-dwelling creatures and land animals of all sizes—from those as large as Mount Meru to those barely larger than a hair's tip—suffer tremendously as they constantly kill and eat one another. Large predators swallow numerous smaller creatures, while smaller ones sometimes bore into the bodies of larger ones. Wild animals endure constant terror as they become prey for hunters seeking their meat, skin, and bones, while domesticated animals suffer from being ridden, loaded with burdens, milked, and slaughtered.\n\nThese animals, utterly foolish and ignorant about what to adopt and abandon, have no opportunity to perceive the light of the holy Dharma. The prayer asks that they be forever freed from the great terror of this suffering, based on the power of whatever virtues exist in oneself and others.\n\nThe text then turns to hungry ghosts (pretas), wishing that they may attain happiness just like the humans of Uttarakuru in the north. Pretas, who result from coveting others' wealth while being stingy with one's own possessions, suffer intensely—going for thousands of years without even hearing the word 'water,' their bodies emaciated and ugly like burnt tree stumps. Some have needle-thin throats and enormous bellies that can never be filled, while others are tormented by burning stones and hot sand.\n\nThe prayer wishes that just as the fortunate humans of Uttarakuru naturally enjoy abundant possessions without claiming ownership, with food, clothing, and enjoyments arising merely by thinking of them, likewise may all hungry ghosts dwelling in countless world systems enjoy excellent happiness with food, drink, clothing, ornaments, and all desired sense pleasures.

This nectar is sweet, cool to the touch, and immeasurable in its abundance.\n\n**ཡི་དྭགས་རྣམས་ནི་ཚིམ་བྱས་ཤིང་། །**\nThis line explains that the hungry ghosts (pretas) are satisfied by this nectar. The first commentary elaborates that these hungry ghosts' mouths and throats become widened by the nectar, allowing them to consume food and drink freely, relieving their perpetual hunger and thirst.

This prayer aspires that all pregnant women be freed from such suffering and give birth like Queen Māyā—without harm, bringing forth children with auspicious marks and pleasing appearances, free from illness or complications.

    "<10><26> Combined Commentary:\n\nThe verse is about seeking divine protection for vulnerable beings in dangerous places. 'May the deities protect children, the elderly without protectors, those who are asleep, intoxicated, and highly intoxicated in remote monasteries and other pathless, frightening places.'\n\nThese 'pathless, frightening places' refer to remote wilderness areas inhabited by dangerous creatures like tigers, wolves, and venomous snakes - places rarely traveled by humans and rumored to be home to malevolent spirits and demons. The terrain itself presents dangers with high cliffs and mountains where one could easily become lost.\n\nThe vulnerable beings mentioned include children and the elderly who lack protectors, beggars, those who fall asleep from exhaustion during journeys, those who become intoxicated and lose mindfulness, and those completely drunk who wander carelessly. In such vulnerable states, these beings are at risk from harmful spirits that might steal their life-force or even kill them.\n\nThe prayer asks that noble deities from the pure realms - including the seventy-five glorious protectors, each person's five personal deities, and local land spirits - all protectors aligned with virtue, safeguard these vulnerable beings from such dangers.\n\nThis verse forms part of a larger section on dedicating merit: specifically for people to attain excellence, enter the authentic path, and obtain temporary prosperity and happiness. It exemplifies the compassionate wish that even the most vulnerable beings receive divine protection when they are in perilous circumstances beyond human help.",

Without such faith, one engages in reversed adoption and rejection, leading only to continuous rebirth in lower realms.\n\n'And wisdom' refers to the eye of wisdom that clearly discerns what to adopt and reject. Those without wisdom are foolish and deluded; they cannot accomplish even the purposes of this life, let alone understand or accomplish the holy Dharma. May they possess perfect wisdom, both innate and cultivated.\n\n'And loving compassion' indicates great compassionate love for all sentient beings, like a mother's love for her children. Since compassion is the root of the Mahāyāna path, those without it who engage in thoughts and actions lacking compassion experience suffering in both this and future lives.\n\n'Having obtained excellent food' means avoiding impure food, sinful substances like meat and alcohol, and the five types of wrong livelihood (hypocrisy, flattery, indirect solicitation, extortion, and seeking gain through gain). May beings possess the perfection of pure livelihood, being content with whatever honest sustenance is available.\n\n'And conduct' refers to avoiding negative behaviors such as disrespecting parents, dishonest trade, breaking vows, and violating samaya. Instead, may beings maintain pure ethical conduct, adorn their minds with the seven noble riches, and engage in study, contemplation, and meditation that brings unsurpassed benefit to the Dharma and sentient beings.\n\n'May I always remember my previous lifetimes' acknowledges that remembering past lives leads to trust in karma and its effects, awakens the disposition of bodhicitta, and ensures one does not forget the mind of enlightenment. This brings great benefits, as exemplified by those who remembered their past lives and attained high spiritual accomplishments.",

Similarly, may all sentient beings possess vast, dharma-consistent resources that never become exhausted, just as if they had attained this meditative concentration, freeing them from the unfavorable conditions that hinder Dharma practice.\n\n'May they be without dispute and harm.' This means may beings be free from quarreling over possessions and be without the fatigue of day and night vigilance. May they be without mutual conflicts and disputes, particularly those who have become objects of contempt and possess little splendor.\n\n'May they enjoy with independence.'

This reflects the historical view that male bodies were more conducive to liberation.\n\n'May the lowly attain high status' refers to those of low social standing—such as horse-butchers, tax collectors, corpse carriers, butchers, and others who are despised due to their inferior lineage, wealth, or occupation. The prayer wishes that they be freed from their disadvantaged conditions and attain respected positions with good lineage and wealth.\n\n'And may pride be vanquished' means that after attaining higher status, may their arrogance and pride also be defeated. This is important because pride is a major obstacle on the spiritual path, so the prayer wishes that even after attaining better circumstances, may they remain humble, peaceful, and disciplined rather than becoming proud of their new status.",

These negativities represent obstacles to liberation and include all works of Māra such as distractions, dullness, excitement, and regret which impede spiritual progress.\n\n'རྟག་ཏུ་དགེ་བ་བྱེད་པར་ཤོག །' (May they always engage in virtuous conduct)\nThe final line is an aspiration that all beings continuously and uninterruptedly engage in excellent virtuous actions. This encompasses both aspiration (being inseparable from bodhicitta) and application (engaging in the six perfections that accomplish the benefit of others), representing the complete path of the bodhisattva.\n\nThis dedication of merit (pariṇāmanā/བསྔོ་བ) is a standard practice in Buddhism where the practitioner transforms personal spiritual achievements into a universal force benefiting all beings, reflecting the essence of the Mahayana path.",
    "<10><32> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nIn particular, all paths of a bodhisattva can be condensed into two aspects: intention and application. For intention, may we never be separated from the mind of awakening (bodhicitta)—with its two aspects of aspirational and engaged. For application, may we be devoted to bodhisattva conduct (bodhicarya), fulfilling the welfare of others through the six perfections such as generosity and so forth.\n\nMay we be embraced and thoroughly accepted by the Buddhas as favorable companions and spiritual mentors, who care for us with their great compassion. And may we abandon all adverse conditions, which are Māra's activities that create obstacles to virtue—including busyness, distraction, drowsiness, dullness, agitation, regret, and so forth.\n\nRegarding these activities of Māra, many sutras explain them extensively, as summarized by Maitreya in the Prajñāpāramitā: 'Māra especially rises against those who practice diligently.' Māra appears in various guises, even as spiritual friends, and creates obstacles through discord, pride, sense pleasures, and other means. For the lazy, laziness itself is Māra. However, as stated in the Samcayagāthā, the wise bodhisattva who abides in emptiness, never abandons sentient beings, acts in accordance with their words, and is blessed by the Sugatas cannot be overcome by the four Māras.\n\nThis verse represents a dedication for being inseparable from bodhicitta, devoted to bodhisattva conduct, being accepted by the Buddhas, and abandoning all Māra's activities—creating favorable conditions for the fulfillment of our spiritual wishes.",

It increases faith in the Buddha, devotion to the Dharma, and causes the gathering of the Saṅgha. It reduces the three poisons of desire, hatred, and ignorance.

As the Buddha himself stated: 'Those of corrupt moral discipline will go to lower realms; even their extensive learning cannot protect them,' and 'For those of corrupt moral discipline, the Lord of Sages has not taught the accomplishment of mantras.'

This knowledge prevents spiritual regression and strengthens compassionate resolve.\n\n'And obtain renunciation' - Here Śāntideva prays for the perfect ethical discipline of ordination in all future lives. As the Samādhirāja Sūtra teaches, upholding even one precept during degenerate times generates immense merit, far surpassing offerings made to countless Buddhas over eons. Ordination provides the ideal foundation for spiritual development, as household life entangles one in faults while the renunciant's life cultivates qualities bringing benefit in this and future lives.",
    "<10><52> Combined Commentary\n\n'May I sustain myself with even simple alms food while maintaining physical strength and vitality.' This verse expresses the aspiration to remain healthy and energetic even with humble nourishment, showing the practitioner's non-attachment to elaborate meals while recognizing the importance of maintaining bodily health for spiritual practice.\n\n'In all future lifetimes until attaining Buddhahood, may I obtain perfect conditions for dwelling in solitude.' Here, the author prays to have ideal circumstances for solitary practice throughout all future rebirths. This refers to obtaining outer, inner, and secret seclusion—physically isolated places free from disturbance where the body and mind can remain undistracted.\n\nThe aspiration for 'perfect conditions' or 'complete conditions' suggests not just physical isolation but all necessary supports for effective practice, including appropriate shelter, basic sustenance, and freedom from obstacles to contemplation.\n\nThe profound value of solitude is emphasized in the Candrapradīpa Sūtra, which states that taking just seven steps toward solitude after contemplating its qualities generates greater merit than making offerings to all Buddhas of the ten directions for eons. This demonstrates why the author places such importance on this aspiration.",

    "<10><54> Combined Commentary\n\n**For the sake of all sentient beings who pervade the ten directions reaching to the limits of space,** this line refers to the vast scope of the aspiration, encompassing all beings without exception throughout the entirety of space in all ten directions (the four cardinal directions, four intermediate directions, plus above and below).\n\n**In order to accomplish their welfare,** this means to fulfill both the temporary and ultimate benefits of all sentient beings—their immediate needs as well as their ultimate liberation and enlightenment.\n\n**Just as Mañjuśrī performs his conduct,** refers to how Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva of wisdom, engages in inconceivable enlightened activities through his emanations of body, speech, and mind, solely dedicated to benefiting others with perfect wisdom.\n\n**May my conduct also become like that.** This final line is a sincere dedication and aspiration that one's own actions might exactly mirror those of Mañjuśrī, becoming solely focused on accomplishing the welfare of others. This verse represents the practitioner's commitment to emulate the enlightened conduct of Mañjuśrī and other great bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara (compassion), Vajrapāṇi (power), and Samantabhadra (liberation).",
    "<10><55> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nཇི་སྲིད་ནམ་མཁའ་གནས་པ་དང་། །\nFor as long as space exists and endures,\n\nThis opening line establishes the timeframe for the bodhisattva's commitment - it is not temporary but will last as long as space itself exists, indicating an infinite commitment that transcends ordinary time.\n\nའགྲོ་བ་ཇི་སྲིད་གནས་གྱུར་པ། །\nFor as long as wandering beings remain,\n\nThis line further emphasizes the extent of the commitment - the bodhisattva vows to remain not only as long as space exists, but as long as there are beings trapped in cyclic existence (saṃsāra) who need assistance.\n\nདེ་སྲིད་བདག་ནི་གནས་གྱུར་ནས། །\nFor that long may I too remain,\n\nThe bodhisattva pledges to postpone their own entry into nirvāṇa, choosing instead to remain present and active in the world for the benefit of others, demonstrating the profound ideal of bodhicitta that places others' liberation before one's own.\n\nའགྲོ་བའི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་སེལ་བར་ཤོག །\nMay I dispel the sufferings of all beings.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of the bodhisattva's commitment is revealed - to alleviate all forms of suffering experienced by beings, including the sufferings of saṃsāra and the lower realms, through compassionate action and the sharing of liberating wisdom.",
    "<10><56> Combined Commentary\n\n'Whatever sufferings of beings—in the hells and so on—exist, whatever they may be' refers to all forms of suffering experienced by sentient beings throughout the six realms, without exception. 'May all of them ripen upon me' is the bodhisattva's extraordinary wish to take on others' suffering, thereby cleansing and purifying their negative karma. 'Through the bodhisattvas' aspiration' indicates relying on the power of the bodhisattva's accumulations of merit and wisdom, as well as their prayers. 'May all beings enjoy happiness' expresses the ultimate wish that through this exchange, all limitless beings may experience both temporary well-being and ultimate happiness. This verse represents the third point in the text's structure: the dedication for the flourishing of the teachings that are the source of happiness, showing how the bodhisattva path brings about extensive benefit for all beings.",
    "<10><57> Combined Commentary on the Source Text\n\n**འགྲོ་བའི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་སྨན་གཅིག་པུ།**\nThe precious teachings of the Buddha are the supreme and unique medicine that pacifies without exception all the diseases of suffering for countless sentient beings in cyclic existence and the lower realms. As the commentaries emphasize, this is the incomparable remedy that cures the disease of suffering afflicting all living beings.\n\n**བདེ་བ་ཐམས་ཅད་འབྱུང་བའི་གནས།**\nThese teachings are the sacred source from which arise all excellent temporary and ultimate happiness. The Buddha's Dharma is the supreme wellspring that produces every form of happiness, from the mundane pleasures of higher rebirth to the ultimate bliss of liberation and enlightenment.\n\n**བསྟན་པ་རྙེད་དང་བཀུར་སྟི་དང་།**\nThe Buddha's teaching includes both the scriptural teachings (the three baskets of Vinaya, Sutras, and Abhidharma) and the realized teachings (the three trainings of discipline, concentration, and wisdom). May this precious teaching remain with abundant material support and reverence bestowed by faithful patrons upon those who uphold the Dharma.\n\n**བཅས་ཏེ་ཡུན་རིང་གནས་གྱུར་ཅིག**\nMay these teachings remain for a long time—as long as samsara itself—together with material support and honor. This aspiration should be made with the four connections: connection with aspiration, devotion, commitment, and supplication to the Three Jewels to make this possible.\n\nThe benefits of upholding the Dharma are limitless, as stated in many sutras. Those who make offerings to the teachings will enjoy abundant wealth for thousands of eons. Those who practice discipline, meditation, and especially wisdom that realizes emptiness gain immeasurable merit. Through hearing the Dharma, one dispels ignorance, abandons wrongdoing, and attains liberation. Even a single step taken to hear or explain the Dharma is considered upholding the sublime teachings, producing merit that could not be exhausted even if all Buddhas described it for billions of eons.",
    "<10><58> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nI reverently bow to Mañjughoṣa, by whose grace my mind inclines toward virtue. \n*This opening line expresses homage to Mañjughoṣa (Gentle Voice), who serves as the contributing condition through whose kindness arises the virtuous mind to engage in spiritual practice. It acknowledges that through his blessing, the author is inspired to abandon attachment to meaningless worldly activities and instead dedicate themselves single-pointedly to virtuous endeavors such as learning, contemplation, meditation, developing bodhicitta, training in bodhisattva conduct, and composing this treatise with these as its subject matter.*\n\nI also pay homage to the spiritual friend through whose kindness I have flourished.\n*This second line of homage acknowledges the human spiritual guides whose kindness enabled the author to progress spiritually. Through their guidance, the author was able to leave home for the monastic life, receive full ordination, and develop qualities of scriptural learning and realization. These spiritual friends established the author in proper training and helped develop their realization through hearing, contemplation, and meditation, causing the virtuous aspects of their mindstream to flourish and increase.*\n\nThis prostration is performed through remembering the kindness of these benefactors with deep gratitude. Just as described in these verses of homage, we too should recognize that whatever small qualities of scriptural understanding and realization we possess came through someone's kindness. We must regard that person as our guru and, remembering their kindness, bow respectfully with our three doors of body, speech, and mind.",
    "<10><59> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nབྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་སྤྱོད་པ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་ལས་བསྔོ་བ་ཞེས་བྱ་བའི་ལེའུ་སྟེ་བཅུ་པའོ།། །\nThis concludes the tenth chapter, entitled 'Dedication of Merit' (or 'The Chapter on Perfect Dedication'), from the Bodhicharyāvatāra (Entry into the Bodhisattva's Way of Life). This final chapter is particularly significant as it describes the practice of dedication, wherein one transforms one's accumulated merit through intense aspiration toward both temporary and ultimate goals. The chapter extensively explains the practice of generosity—giving one's body, possessions, and roots of virtue for the benefit of others. Since the method of practicing generosity was explained intermittently throughout earlier chapters, a separate chapter specifically on generosity was not composed.\n\n།བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་སྤྱོད་པ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་སློབ་དཔོན་ཤཱནྟ་དེ་བས་མཛད་པ་རྫོགས་སོ།། །\nThe Bodhicharyāvatāra, composed by the great master Śāntideva (Zhiwa Lha in Tibetan), is hereby completed. Śāntideva was directly blessed by venerable Mañjuśrī and abandoned royal power as if it were mere spittle dust. Endowed with many marvelous practices, he perfected bodhisattva conduct. In particular, by practicing the utterly unelaborate conduct of unsurpassed yoga, he attained the state of Vajradhara. This excellent explanation of his words and meaning is now complete.",
    "<10><60> Combined Commentary Explanation\n\nThis colophon describes the translation history of this text in three distinct phases. Initially, the Indian preceptor Sarvajñadeva (whose name means 'Deity of Omniscience') together with the great translator Bande Paltsegs—who was considered among the luminaries of translation, comparable to 'the combined sun and moon' according to Ngog Lotsāwa—translated this text from a Kashmiri manuscript into Tibetan and established a first definitive version.\n\nLater, the text underwent a second translation phase when the Indian preceptor Dharmaśrībhadra (meaning 'Auspicious Glory of Dharma') collaborated with two great translators: Bande Rinchen Zangpo (whom Ngog compared to 'the morning star') and Śākya Lodrö. They revised the previous translation by comparing it with a manuscript from Central India along with its commentary, correcting it and establishing an improved definitive version.\n\nFinally, in a third phase, the Indian preceptor Sumatikīrti (meaning 'Wise Intelligence of Good Fame')—identified by Sazang in his commentary as 'a Nepalese paṇḍita'—and the great translator monk Loden Sherab undertook a thorough correction and retranslation of the text, producing what the colophon describes as 'an excellent definitive version.' Sazang notes in his commentary that he himself further corrected parts 'that had become somewhat imperfect in the interim by consulting the Sanskrit manuscript and commentary.'"
